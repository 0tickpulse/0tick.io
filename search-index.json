Act: What things are in actuality. Potency: What things can potentially be. Both are conceived as \"modes\" of being, so they are all real. Parmenides was an ancient Greek philosopher who argued that change is impossible: Change requires a being to arise from nothingness. Nothingness cannot produce anything. Therefore, change is impossible. Aquinas' act-potency distinction allows him to avoid this problem. However, it also leads to some other problems. First, the act of staying the same is also a kind of change, and can be seen as a kind of potentiality. This means that everything has at least one potential, that of staying the same. This \"everything\" includes the unmoved mover, which means that the unmoved mover is not actually unmoved. Second, many philosophers argue that it leads to an actual infinity of potentials.

This is a more epistemic interpretation. As a relation - this could be causation, or a realization, or a grounding relation. For example, the structure of transistors grounds the structure of a circuit. An object cannot be its own reason for existence, because that would imply that it is prior and posterior to itself. Even in an epistemic sense, it would not make any sense to say \" is true because is true\". This means that must be explained by , and must be explained by , and so on ad infinitum. One way to stop this infinite regress is to construct a causal loop, but this leads to circular reasoning, which is, to a certain extent, a type of self explanation. The next logical question is to ask why the infinite chain exists in the first place. This cannot be explained by any constituent elements in the chain, because the chain itself is the object of explanation. It would not make sense to say \"there are fish in the sea because there is a fish in the sea\". One could posit an explanation for the chain, but that would itself be then part of the chain.

If is contingent, then is part of the BCCF, which means is self-explanatory. This cannot be the case, so must be necessary. However, not all conjuctions like the BCCF make sense.

If is self-conjunctive, since contains non-self-conjunctive propositions, it is not self-conjunctive.

This presents a major contradiction, and so the BCCF is not necessarily a coherent concept. The BCCF is highly criticized. For instance, this paper by Christopher M. P. Tomaszewski, titled \"The Principle of Sufficient Reason Defended: There Is No Conjunction of All Contingently True Propositions\", completely rejects the idea of a BCCF. The paper refutes Peter van Inwagen's argument that the PSR entails \"modal collapse\", where absolutely everything is necessary. Tomazewski states that a critical flaw in van Inwagen's argument is the assumption that there is a conjuction of all contingently true propositions. He argues that there are too many propositions to conjunct through the use of Cantor's Theorem (directly quoted from the paper): There is a conjunction of all contingently true propositions . For each non-empty collection of propositions which are conjuncts of , there is a unique contingently true proposition to which it corresponds. Every such contingently true proposition is a conjunct of .

(From Cantor's Theorem) There are strictly more propositions which are conjuncts of than there are propositions which are conjuncts of .

Start with a collection of conjuncts of , say , and let be the proposition that is the conjunction of all the conjuncts in . Let be an arbitrary necessary proposition. Then, consider the proposition : Each is a proposition that belongs to this collection. The inclusion of means that is not logicall equivalent to any conjunction of the propositions in , and must hence be included in .

It is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra is used in basically every field of mathematics, from number theory to geometry to topology to logic. Although we have already learned a lot of algebra in school, the algebra we learned is only a small part of the vast field of algebra. The algebra we learned in school is called elementary algebra, and it deals with the basic operations of arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Abstract algebra, on the other hand, is a more advanced form of algebra that deals with more abstract mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. These structures are used to study the properties of mathematical objects, such as numbers, vectors, and matrices, in a more general and systematic way. Before we dive into the details of abstract algebra, we need to first establish preliminary concepts and definitions that will be used throughout abstract algebra, such as sets, logic, and proofs.","s":"Abstract Algebra","u":"/notes/maths/Abstract Algebra/Introduction","h":"","p":112},{"i":115,"t":"The first important concept in abstract algebra is how logic and proofs work.

Axioms are the starting point, and theorems are the conclusions. Note that: Axioms must not contradict each other. Since they are all true, they must all be true at the same time, hence they must be consistent. Axioms must be independent. If one axiom can be derived from the others, then it is not an axiom, but a theorem. A logical system cannot have too many axioms.

For example: All cats we have seen are mammals. Therefore, all cats are mammals. Inductive reasoning is not as strong as deductive reasoning, but it is still useful in many contexts. Generally, in science, we use inductive reasoning to make generalizations from specific observations. However, in mathematics, we use deductive reasoning to prove theorems from axioms.

You can think of displacement as the distance between the starting and ending points of an object's motion.

These subjects provide the foundation for calculus and are essential for understanding the concepts and techniques of calculus, and are therefore prerequisites for studying calculus, or \"pre-calculus\". Then, students typically study differential calculus, which deals with the study of the rate at which quantities change. This includes topics such as limits, derivatives, and applications of derivatives. After studying differential calculus, students typically study integral calculus, which deals with the accumulation of quantities. This includes topics such as integrals, techniques of integration, and applications of integrals. Finally, students may study multivariable calculus, which extends the concepts of differential and integral calculus to functions of several variables. Calculus 1 and 2 are typically the first two courses in a calculus sequence, and cover the topics of differential and integral calculus, respectively. These courses are typically taken by students in their first or second year of college or university. AP Calculus AB and BC are somewhat equivalent to Calculus 1 and 2, respectively, though there's some differences in the content covered. Calculus 3 is typically the third course in a calculus sequence, and covers the topics of multivariable calculus. This course is typically taken by students in their second or third year of college or university. The notes in this section cover AP Calculus BC, but is written as Calculus 1 and 2, since there will eventually be a Calculus 3 section. There are many topics beyond Calculus 3. Differential Equations are typically studied after Calculus 3, and deal with the study of equations involving derivatives. This includes topics such as first-order differential equations, second-order differential equations, and systems of differential equations. This is important especially in physics and engineering. Linear Algebra is typically studied after Calculus 3, and deals with the study of vectors, vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations. This is important especially in physics, engineering, and computer science. Real Analysis is typically studied after Calculus 3, and goes back to the foundations of calculus, rigorously defining limits, derivatives, and integrals. This is important especially for students who plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics. Complex Analysis is typically studied after Real Analysis, and deals with the study of complex numbers and functions. This is important especially for students who, again, plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics. Partial Differential Equations are typically studied after Differential Equations, and deal with the study of equations involving partial derivatives. There are also some obscure topics in calculus, such as: Functional Analysis, which is the study of infinite-dimensional vector spaces and operators on those spaces. Differential Geometry, which is the study of geometry using calculus. Measure Theory, which is the study of measures and integration. Fractional Calculus, which is the study of calculus involving fractional derivatives and integrals.

For example, if we graph the function for , we get: When visualizing parametric equations, you can think of the input as time. Then, you sort-of trace out the path of the function as time progresses.

Firstly, many people emphasize on the basis-free, theoretical approach to linear algebra. This approach focuses on the abstract properties of vector spaces, linear transformations, and other structures. Vector spaces are defined axiomatically, and theorems are proven about these abstract structures. In fact, vector spaces are a special case of a more general algebraic structure called a module, and many results in linear algebra can be generalized to modules over a ring. On the other hand, when we actually apply linear algebra to solve problems, we will need to work with matrices and vectors in a more concrete way.

If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\" G. H. Hardy, 1940 The definition for mathematics is not as clear-cut as one might think. As the study of numbers - this is only partially true. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but also about shapes, patterns, and relationships. Many things deal with non-numerical concepts, such as geometry, topology, logic, and set theory. As a deductive science - this is also only partially true. Mathematical reasoning is not just deductive, but also inductive, sometimes even abductive. Many things deal with inductive reasoning, such as statistics, probability, and combinatorics. Rather than being \"pure\" or \"applied\", mathematics is a spectrum of both, and various fields of mathematics can lie anywhere on this spectrum. As the \"science of formal systems\" (Haskell Curry in 1951) - this does not capture the full essence of mathematics. Mathematics is not just about formal systems, but also about intuition, creativity, and discovery. Pure math without intuition is soulless. However, the definitions aside, there are some common themes in mathematics: Mathematics is about abstracting away the unnecessary details and focusing on the essential properties of objects. The first thing you learn, numbers, are abstractions of the real world. The number 1 is not a physical object; you can't say \"give me 1\". Instead, numbers, are abstractions of counting, and they have properties that are useful in various contexts. One advantage of abstraction is that it allows us to study a wide range of objects with similar properties. For instance, the same differential equations that describe the motion of a pendulum can also describe the flow of heat in a metal rod. Mathematics is logical. It is about making precise arguments and drawing conclusions from them. You start with a set of axioms, which are assumed to be true, and then use logical reasoning to derive theorems. The axioms are the starting point, and the theorems are the conclusions. The process of deriving theorems from axioms is called proof. However, mathematics is not just about proving theorems; estimation, approximation, and conjecture are also important. Mathematics is about patterns and structures. It is about recognizing patterns in the world and using them to build structures. For instance, the Fibonacci sequence is a pattern that appears in many natural phenomena, such as the branching of trees and the arrangement of leaves on a stem. The concept of a group is a structure that appears in many areas of mathematics, such as number theory, geometry, and algebra. Generally, mathematics is a logical, abstract, and creative discipline that studies the world in a precise and structured way.","s":"Introduction to Mathematics","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"","p":497},{"i":500,"t":"As previously mentioned, mathematics mixes together intuition and formulation. The intuition is the visual and intuitive interpretation of the concept, while the formulation is the more formal description that shows how the concept can be generalized and computed. The general discovery process for mathematics is; Specific Example → Intuition → Mathematical Model → Wide-Ranging Applications This shows the advantage of abstraction. By abstracting things into their fundamental properties, we can apply the same concepts to a wide range of problems. For instance, when Newton was studying the motion of the planets, he developed the concept of calculus to describe the motion of objects in general. Today, calculus is used everywhere, from physics to economics to computer science to just about every field you can think of. One shortcoming of the modern education system is that it usually does this process in reverse. It starts with the formulation. This is probably partly responsible for the large distaste for mathematics. It's like learning to paint by starting with the chemical composition of paint.","s":"Discovery Process","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"#discovery-process","p":497},{"i":502,"t":"Mathematics is a vast field, with many different branches and subfields.

These are just a few of the many branches of mathematics. Each branch has its own set of concepts, techniques, and applications, yet they are all interconnected in some way. Another way to categorize mathematics is by its level of abstraction: Pure mathematics, which studies abstract concepts and structures for their own sake. Applied mathematics, which uses mathematical tools and techniques to solve real-world problems. Pure and applied mathematics are not mutually exclusive; they are two ends of a spectrum. Many areas of mathematics lie somewhere in between, using abstract concepts to solve practical problems. One particular saying I like is that \"pure mathematics explores the world of mathematics, while applied mathematics explores the world with mathematics\".

T: i.e. if it is necessary that , then . 5: i.e. if it is possible that , then it is necessary that it is possible that . Oppy's paper begins with the preliminary definitions for the argument: Def 1: A possible world is a maximal compossible conjunction of abstract propositions. Def 2: The Big Conjunctive Fact—BCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Def 3: The Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact—BCCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the contingent propositions that would be true if that world were actual.

Maximal means that there are no other propositions that can be added to the conjunction without making it inconsistent. This means that for any proposition , either or is in the conjunction. Oppy makes a distinction between the weak and strong PSR, noting the primary difference being a proposition \"possibly having an explanation\" or just \"having an explanation\". Then, Oppy writes a paragraph to show that the first premise of the Gale-Pruss argument entails the strong PSR: Suppose that there is a world which is such that the BCF for that world has no explanation in that world. Let the BCF for that world be . Consider the conjunctive proposition: and has no explanation. By hypothesis, this conjunctive proposition is true in .

It reports the \"state of affairs\" (the state of a system at a given time) being governed by the laws of nature. A personal explanation is one that explains a fact by appealing to the intentions of a person. For instance, to explain why a glass broke, a scientific explanation would involve the laws of physics, while a personal explanation would involve the intentions of a person who broke the glass. Gale and Pruss point out that scientific explanations are generalizations over contingent facts, hence scientific explanations are also contingent and included in the BCCP. Thus the explanation of the BCCP must be a personal explanation, which involves a necessary being. However, this fails to consider one small detail: there are other types of explanations, such as: Metaphysical explanations; one that cites neither intentions nor the evolution of some system or the state of the system at a given time, governed by the laws of nature. For instance, Pruss is an Aristotelian. Aristotelianism posits formal causality, the claim that there are \"forms\" that underlie the existence of things. This form is not a personal agent with intentions causing the various parts to combine, nor is this a scientific explanation. In science, one would not appeal to substantial forms, since it is a metaphysical explanation. Furthermore, it is not governed by \"deterministic or statistical\" laws of nature, and does not deal with some state of affairs. Other examples of metaphysical explanations include the concept of grounding; the structure of DNA is grounded in the laws of chemistry. However, this is not a scientific explanation according to their definition, since it does not involve the state of a system at some time being governed by the laws of nature. Functional realization is another example; things have functions and are realized by certain structures. Part of the reason why something exists is because its constituents realize a certain function. Ethical explanations; these are explanations that involve moral facts. For instance, to explain why violence is wrong, one might appeal to the fact that it causes suffering. This does not cite the intentions of a person or the laws of nature, and is hence not a scientific or personal explanation. Mathematical explanations; these are explanations that involve mathematical facts. For instance, to explain why , one might appeal to the axioms of arithmetic. Additionally, neither the argument nor the paper by Gale and Pruss provide sufficient explanation for the contingency of scientific explanations. Science could rely on necessary truths, such as some fundamental laws of nature, quantum fields, universal wavefunctions, and the like. In conclusion, this distinction is first, a false dichotomy, and second, does not hold up to scrutiny.","s":"Distinction between Types of Explanations","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Gale Pruss CA","h":"#distinction-between-types-of-explanations","p":626},{"i":641,"t":"Previously, we introduced the cross product of two vectors in 3D space.

The product should output one vector; there should be no ambiguity in the result. The product should follow the usual rules of multiplication, such as: The cross product satisfies all these conditions and, in addition, has some interesting geometric properties.

Our condition for the cross product was that it should output one vector. Additionally, there should be a one-to-one correspondence between the directions of the input vectors and the output vector. This means that changing the directions of and should also change the direction of the cross product. One clever way to make the cross product depend on the directions of and is to make it perpendicular to both vectors. Imagine and as two vectors that define a plane. Then, the cross product should be perpendicular to this plane; it should \"stick out\" of the plane: However, there are two directions perpendicular to a plane - one pointing \"up\" and one pointing \"down\". We need a way to choose one of these directions without ambiguity. One way to do this is to use the right-hand rule. This rule is a convention, and it is used to ensure that the cross product is well-defined: The direction of the cross product is given by the right-hand rule: if you curl the fingers of your right hand from to , your thumb points in the direction of . Note that this has an interesting consequence: the cross product is not commutative. If you swap the order of the vectors, the direction of the cross product changes. Instead, the cross product is anticommutative: Also, this means that the cross product is only defined in three dimensions. In lower dimensions, like 2D, there is no unique direction perpendicular to a plane, so the cross product is not defined. In higher dimensions, there are multiple directions perpendicular to a plane, so the cross product is not unique. 3D is the \"sweet spot\" where the cross product is well-defined.","s":"Direction","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Cross Product Introduction","h":"#direction","p":690},{"i":701,"t":"In this page, we introduced the cross product as a way to multiply vectors.

In Clifford algebra, we can represent scalars, vectors, and even higher-dimensional objects like planes and volumes using a single mathematical object called a multivector. This system is very powerful and has applications in physics, computer graphics, and robotics. The geometric product is a very deep topic, and we will not delve into it in this note. We will just discuss two important things about the geometric product: In Clifford algebra, cross products are replaced by the wedge product.

This force is a vector quantity; its magnitude is the strength of the force, and its direction is the direction in which the force is applied. For example, if you push a box to the right, the force you apply is a vector pointing to the right. When a force is applied to an object, it can move by a certain distance . The quantity, work, represents how much energy is transferred to the object by the force. Thinking intuitively, if you push a box with the same force over a longer distance, you are giving it more energy. Similarly, if you push a box with a stronger force over the same distance, you are also giving it more energy. Thus, we can define work, as the product of the magnitudes of the force and distance, right? The problem with this definition is that it does not account for the direction of the force. Imagine you are pushing a box in an upward-right direction against a wall. The force you apply is in the upward-right direction, but the box only moves up. In this case, only the force component in the direction of the motion (up) contributes to the work done. So, in reality, the work done is: But wait... that's just the dot product of the force and the distance vector: The work is an extremely important concept in Physics, and the dot product is the key to understanding it.

When light hits a surface, the intensity of the light is determined by the angle between the light source and the surface. Imagine a scene with a ground, a ball, a lamp, and a camera. The lamp emits light rays in all directions, and some of these rays hit the ball or the ground. Some others hit the ground, bounce off, and hit the ball. For our purposes, treat the camera as simply a grid of pixels. The goal of rendering is simply to determine the color of each of those pixels. The above scene is a simplified version of a rendering setup, with only one pixel on the camera. Let's assume a pixel can only have one color, so the only data is the intensity of light. The way we begin to calculate the intensity of light on a pixel is by imagining the pixel shooting a beam towards the ball. We're essentially working backwards from the camera to the light source. The light hits a point on the ball, denoted by . Denote the vector going from the ball back to the pixel as . Denote the the intensity at the point as . The first contribution to the intensity at is the light emitted from the ball itself. While it does not emit light in this case, in other cases, it would glow with a certain intensity. This can be denoted as . Hence: For the other contributions, we keep working backwards. Starting at point , we consider all the light that hits it by shooting rays from the point in all directions. For example, consider the light that hits directly from the lamp. It comes from a direction . Now, we need to think about the contributions from the lamp to the intensity at : How reflective the ball is; this is denoted by the reflectance of the ball, , where just means the light comes from and reflects to . The intensity of light at the point on the ball where the light hits, . The third factor is the angle between the light source and the point on the ball where the light hits. This is the key part. If the light was closer to the normal of the surface, it would be more intense, and vice versa. Wait... that's just a dot product: So we add a factor of to the equation. Hence, the intensity at due to the light from the lamp is: That's just the light coming from one specific direction (the lamp). To get the total intensity at , we need to consider all the light coming from all directions. More specifically, all directions from which light can hit - a hemisphere around the point, denoted by . Since we are going towards a continuous case (all directions), instead of thinking about individual directions , it's better to think of as a small cone of directions. The intensity at due to the light from the lamp is then the sum of the intensities from all these cones: As we make the cones smaller and smaller, this sum becomes an integral: Finally, the total intensity at is the emitted light plus the light from all other sources (which is the integral above): What we have just derived is known as the rendering equation.","s":"Lighting in Graphics","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Dot Product Applications","h":"#lighting-in-graphics","p":704},{"i":715,"t":"Recall that the dot product of two vectors and can be thought of as a measure of their similarity.

For example, let's consider the vectors that lie on a line passing through the origin: Assume we have some set of vectors that lie on this line. If we perform operations on these vectors, such as addition and scalar multiplication, will the resulting vectors still lie on the line? In other words, will operating on these vectors cause them to \"leak out\" of the line?

If you multiply a vector on the line by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie on the line, since the direction of the vector does not change. Therefore, we can say that this line is a linear subspace of the vector space. A consequence of something being a linear subspace is that it itself is also a vector space.

These vectors are often represented as arrows in space, where the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector: To a programmer, a vector is just a list of numbers. It could be used to represent a point in space, but it could also represent other things. For example, very commonly, we can represent a color as a vector. All colors can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, so a color can be represented as a vector with three components. We hence call this vector three-dimensional. Vectors can also be used to represent other things that do not have to do with space. You could have a three-dimensional vector representing a person's age, height, and weight for example. These also apply in scientific studies. For instance, given a chemical reaction, we can represent each reactant and product as a separate component in a vector. In a reaction with 3 reactants and 2 products, we can represent the reaction as a 5-dimensional vector. Another example is in mathematics itself, where we can represent a polynomial as a list of its coefficients. To a mathematician, a vector is a member of a vector space. This is a more abstract definition, but it is the most general. A vector can be anything that has the notion of addition and multiplication defined on it. We will go into detail about this later. Vectors, as variables, can be notated in a few ways as well: As a bold lowercase letter, like . This is the most common way to notate vectors in digital text.

However, note that the starting point of the vector is arbitrary. It can be more helpful to think of the vector as an \"instruction\" to move from the tail to the tip. If you imagine the -axis as east and the -axis as north, then the vector is an instruction to move 2 units east and 1 unit north. It will have the same meaning no matter where you place it in the coordinate system. To represent this vector as a list of numbers, we can look at the coordinates of the tip of the vector.

This means that in real analysis, we are primarily concerned with functions defined on the real number line. This also means that there are other types of analysis, such as complex analysis, which deal with functions defined on the complex plane.

Philosophers like John Locke (1632 - 1704) and Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796) pushed the concept of empiricism which posits that knowledge comes from one's experience. This was in contrast to rationalism, which posited that knowledge comes from reason. In the 19th century, physiological studies began investigating the human sensory systems. German philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 - 1894) measured the speed of nerve impulses and the speed of sound, and eventually, he came to the conclusion that senses are not infallible. This means that the senses can be fooled; that is, there is a psychological reality that is separate from the physical reality. While this was not a new idea, it was a new way of thinking about the senses. Helmholtz's work suggests that despite the fallibility of the senses, we can still use science to measure and understand the mind. This relationship between physical and psychological reality was studied by German researchers like Gustav Fechner (1801 - 1887) and Ernst Weber (1795 - 1878) in what's known as psychophysics. German physician Wilhelm Wundt (1832 - 1920) is often credited with establishing the first psychology laboratory in 1879. He: First strongly promoted the idea of psychology as an experimental science. Provided classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for students to study psychology. (1875) joined the University of Leipzig as a professor, making plans to establish a course in experimental psychology. (1879) established the first laboratory experience - usually considered the birth of psychology as a science. Wundt's work received great responses with students from all over the world coming to study under him. They were trained on various psychological experiments like: Introspection - the process of looking inward to examine one's own thoughts and feelings. Consciousness - the awareness of internal and external stimuli. Mental Chronometry - the study of reaction time.

He focused on the adult human mind, but excluded children, animals, and people with mental illnesses from his studies. This \"flavor\" of experimental psychology was popular in the United States, and it was taught in many universities. The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892, but Titchener thought it did not represent experimental psychology well. This led him to found the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1904. This society did not welcome women. However, Titchener's student Margaret Floy Washburn (1871 - 1939) is quite interesting: She was the first doctoral student of Titchener.

Where as Titchener was more reductionist, functionalists were more interested in the function of the mind. James states that consciousness is continuous and always changing, and that it cannot be broken down into smaller components. James wrote the most famous psychology textbook of the time, The Principles of Psychology (1890), and also became a professor at Harvard University. Hall also made significant contributions to psychology, and he founded the first psychology laboratory in the United States at Johns Hopkins University in 1883.

Evolution broadly refers to the gradual change in heritable characteristics within a population over time. Natural selection, on the other hand, is a key mechanism driving evolution. It describes the differential survival and reproductive success of individuals possessing traits that make them better suited to their environment. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that evolution is not synonymous with progress. It is not a linear process culminating in the production of more complex or \"advanced\" organisms. Rather, it is a dynamic, non-directional process, with no inherent goal or endpoint. The evolutionary process is contingent upon the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and reproductive success. An important concept in evolution is that of a species. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Humans are, for instance, homo sapiens. Over time, species can change. This is called speciation. Speciation is the process by which new species are formed. It occurs when a group of individuals becomes isolated from the rest of the population. Over time, the isolated group may evolve into a new species.

Oxygen in the atmosphere is almost entirely attributable to photosynthesis: While initial life forms were exclusively anaerobic, the oxygenation of the atmosphere proved toxic, selectively driving the evolution of aerobic organisms - including ourselves, for whom oxygen is now an existential necessity.

This theory works well for objects that are not too small or moving too fast, hence \"everyday\" scales. Problems in classical mechanics are solved primarily by Newton's laws (or by the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, which are more general and can be applied to more complex systems). By the 20th century, classical mechanics was well understood and was considered a \"complete\" theory. However, it was soon discovered that classical mechanics was not sufficient to explain a variety of phenomena, which is why new theories were developed. At very small scales, we have quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum mechanics is based on waves and probabilities, and it is used to describe the behavior of particles like electrons and photons. Quantum mechanics is a very successful theory and has been tested extensively in experiments. At very high speeds, we have special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. From noticing that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames (because its value is based on two fundamental constants), Einstein made a series of postulates that led to the development of special relativity. Special relativity has many interesting consequences, such as time dilation and length contraction. At very large scales, we have general relativity, which describes the behavior of objects with very strong gravitational fields. Originally, due to a discrepancy between the predictions of Newtonian gravity and the observed orbit of Mercury, Einstein developed general relativity. It describes gravity not as a Newtonian force, but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. General relativity has been tested in many ways and has passed all tests so far. In fact, even the acceleration of the universe's expansion, which Einstein initially thought was a mistake in his equations, was later confirmed by observations. Electricity and Magnetism are part of classical physics. Outside of gravity, they are the forces that keep our lives on Earth running. All matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The interactions between these charges are what give rise to electricity and magnetism. This means that all of chemistry, biology, and even the functioning of our brains are based on the principles of electricity and magnetism. In fact, even the light that we see is an electromagnetic wave - the result of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. There are four equations that describe all of classical electromagnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. They are based on the work of many scientists, including Gauss, Ampère, and Faraday, but were first written down in their modern form by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. Maxwell's equations are: Here, is the electric field, and is the magnetic field. A large part of classical electromagnetism is understanding how these fields interact with each other and with charges and currents. Eventually, we will see that these fields can be combined into a single field, known as the electromagnetic field, which is described by a single tensor. This field is what gives rise to electromagnetic waves, which are the basis of what we call light.","s":"Electricity and Magnetism","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electricity and Magnetism","h":"","p":983},{"i":986,"t":"We will try to cover the following topics: Electrostatics: We will start with a study of electric fields and potentials in static situations - when charges are not moving.

This involves the concept of the electric field, as well as Gauss's law, which is the first of Maxwell's equations. Magnetostatics: We will then move on to magnetic fields and potentials in static situations. This is similar to electrostatics, but with a few key differences, since the magnetic force acts a bit differently from the electric force. Electrodynamics: We will then combine electric and magnetic fields to study how they interact with each other and with moving charges.

Assume this is part of some physics problem, and the existence of a term is making the problem difficult to solve.

Thus: And as such, we can solve for : We get a similar result for : Thus, the degree 4 polynomial approximation of is: Notice that adding the higher degree term does not affect the previous terms. For instance, the concavity of is still the same as the concavity of at . Why? When we take the derivative of a term with a higher power of , the power of decreases by one. The concavity is the second derivative, so the power of decreases by two - so it doesn't become a constant term. Recall that we set .

If you set as the mass, you could measure the rate of change of mass, , to determine how much fluid is leaking out. Now, let's consider a vector field that represents the flow of a fluid. The vector field could represent the velocity of the fluid at any point in space. If we have a closed curve in space, can we predict how much fluid is flowing outwards through the curve? This quantity is known as the flux of the vector field through the curve . Denoted as , the flux is a scalar quantity that represents the flow of the vector field through the curve.

We can express the dot product of and as: By the distributivity of the dot product over vector addition, we can expand this expression into the sum of the dot products of the individual components. This is analogous to how we expand the product of two binomials; . Notice that in the product of the two binomials, each term is the product of one term from the first binomial and one term from the second binomial. We get every possible combination of terms from the two binomials. This is the same for trinomials; .

As such, all the terms in the expansion where the basis vectors are different will evaluate to 0, and the terms where the basis vectors are the same will evaluate to 1: Since this proof starts with the geometric definition of the dot product and derives the component definition, it shows that the two definitions are equivalent: Hence, the equivalence is proven.

This means that purely logically, we can derive any result in electrostatics using these two principles. To demosntrate this, we will now solve some a basic problem involving Coulomb's Law and the electric field. There are two goals for basic problems problems like this: To understand how to apply Coulomb's Law and the formula for the electric field to solve problems. To realize that this is a f***ing pain in the a** and we need a better way to do this. The problem is as follows: A solid sphere of radius has a charge uniformly distributed throughout its surface. Find the electric field at a point that is units above the center of the sphere. You will need to use the cosine rule to solve this problem. You will end up with two cases, one where the point is inside the sphere and one where the point is outside the sphere. To solve this problem, we will need to integrate the electric field over the entire surface of the sphere. We shall use spherical coordinates to simplify the calculation. We shall consider a small surface element on the sphere, then use the surface charge density to calculate the charge in this element. The charge density is the charge per unit area, i.e. how much charge is present per unit area of the surface. Since it is uniformly distributed, the charge density is constant and equal to: The surface element is a small patch on the sphere shown below: The area of this surface element is its width times its height, which is . Therefore, the charge in this surface element is: This charge contributes to the electric field at the point . Call this contribution . The key idea is that the contribution is only along the radial (vertical) direction. This is due to the symmetry of the sphere, which means that there is another point, , on the opposite side of the sphere that contributes an equal and opposite electric field in the horizontal direction. A diagram of this is shown below: So we only need to consider the vertical component of the electric field; . To find this component, we need: The charge in the surface element. We already know this to be . The distance from the surface element to the point . We do not know this yet. (I use instead of since looks weird in .) We can construct a triangle with the surface element, the point , and the center of the sphere. This triangle is shown below: We can now find the distance using the cosine rule. (Recall that is the angle from the vertical axis to the point .) With this, we can find the electric field at the point due to the surface element. Remember that only the vertical component of the electric field contributes to the electric field at . We shall use for simplicity. The total electric field at the point is then the sum of the electric fields due to all the surface elements. This is an integral over the entire surface of the sphere. The bounds are and . The angle is the angle between the electric field and the vertical axis. From the cosine rule on we have: To simplify the integral, we can make the subject instead of . By the cosine rule and implicit differentiation, we have: Now, regarding the bounds of the integral, we can visualize from to . (You could calculate the bounds with brute force, but this is a more elegant way to do it.) At , the charge is at the top of the sphere. The diagram below shows for both and : Evidently, the bounds are and . (For , the lower bound of is , while for , the lower bound is .) The upper bound is for both cases: Using both equations, we can rewrite the integral as: From here, it depends on whether or . For , we have : Recall that for a point charge at a distance from the center of the sphere, the electric field is . So the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , we have : So the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Our conclusions are: For , the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Notice how absolutely painful this was. We had to do a complicated spherical integral, and then we had to use a bunch of trigonometry to simplify the result. Any algebraic mistake would have resulted in a wrong answer. And this is all just for a simple sphere with a uniform charge distribution. Imagine doing this for a more complex charge distribution. There is a far better way to do this, and that is by using Gauss's Law. In fact, Gauss's Law is so powerful that a person could probably solve this problem completely mentally.

All matter possesses charge, and it is responsible for the electromagnetic interactions between particles. Classical physics assumes that charge is continuous; that is, it can take on any value. Of course, we know that all charge in the universe is quantized in units of the elementary charge . However, the principles of classical physics still hold to an enormous degree of accuracy. The elementary charge is so small () that in most macroscopic situations, charge appears continuous. The second assumption is that charge distribution is continuous. This means that charge is spread out over a volume, and we can talk about the charge \"density\" at any point in space. Once again, we know that at a microscopic level, charge distribution is not continuous, rather there are particles with discrete charges that make up matter. This is not to say that classical electromagnetism does not study the interactions between individual charges. In fact, the entire field of electrostatics is built on the interactions between individual charges. We will see how Coulomb's Law, the most fundamental law of electrostatics, describes the force between two individual point charges. This is also not to say that classical electromagnetism is not useful; it is actually increasingly important in modern physics. Why? The Theory of Relativity does not change the laws of electromagnetism. In fact, the Theory of Relativity was developed to make electromagnetism consistent with the laws of physics. Quantum Mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, only deviates from classical physics in extreme situations. These situations are so small - ( times smaller than an atom) - that they are not relevant to most macroscopic situations. In fact, we can discuss the behavior of atoms and molecules using classical electromagnetism with great accuracy. In the case that quantum effects are important, a field called quantum electrodynamics is used, which is a quantum mechanical theory of electromagnetism.","s":"Classical View of Charge","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Thinking about Charge","h":"#classical-view-of-charge","p":1308},{"i":1315,"t":"It was experimentally discovered that there are two types of charge, where same charges repel and opposite charges attract. To make it mathematically convenient, we call one type of charge positive and the other negative. As current models suggest, any particle with a charge also has an antiparticle with the exact same properties, just with an opposite charge. This means that there are also antiprotons and positrons, which have negative and positive charges, respectively. Particles and their antiparticles can annihilate each other, releasing energy in the form of photons. This energy is what we see in particle accelerators, where particles are smashed together at high speeds to create new particles and study their properties. In the early universe, when the temperature was high enough, particles and antiparticles were created in equal amounts. Due to some unknown asymmetry in the laws of physics, there was a slight excess of particles over antiparticles. This excess of particles is what makes up all the matter in the universe today. The asymmetry in the laws of physics that caused this excess is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics. The majority of positive charge in the universe is in the form of protons, while the majority of negative charge is in the form of electrons. In an atom, the protons are concentrated in the center, forming the nucleus, while the electrons are spread out in orbitals around the nucleus. The electrons are held in place by the electromagnetic force between the positive protons and the negative electrons. Note that while protons are positive and electrons are negative, this assignment of charge signs is arbitrary. In fact, the assignment of charge signs was done before the discovery of the electron. All charge in the universe is a multiple of the elementary charge . Protons have a charge of , electrons have a charge of , and neutrons have no charge. Protons are part of a class of particles called hadrons, and they have an internal structure made up of three quarks. Namely, a proton is made up of two up quarks (each with a charge of ) and one down quark (with a charge of ). If, then, an isolated quark exists, it would violate the quantization of charge. However, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) prevents the existence of isolated quarks. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we will mostly ignore the quantization of charge in classical electromagnetism. Instead, we act like a charge, , can take on any value, and we can talk about the charge density at any point in space. The charge density can be thought of as an \"average\" charge per unit volume, in the same way that mass density is the \"average\" mass per unit volume.

Meaning, it increases as we move to the right. This can be written as: The second scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the right, and some water flowing in from the left. Recall that the divergence is still positive: Notice that the slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. The last scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the left, and some water flowing in from the right. The slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. In this case, it's very negative at the left, and at the right, it is still negative, but less so. Hence, It should be clear from these scenarios that: Hence, the partial derivative is somehow related to the divergence. We can apply the same logic for the component of the vector field: In this case, the water will only flow vertically. Consider the case where the divergence is positive: Now combine the two components: The divergence of this vector field is then defined as the sum of the partial derivatives of the components: There is something interesting about this formula. We only considered vector fields purely in the and directions. In reality, vector fields can be in any direction. The formula for divergence still holds, since the vectors can always be decomposed into components in the and directions. To use the intuitive example, you could consider a box around the origin, and consider the flow of water in and out of the box. Then, the flow can be decomposed into the (left and right of the box) and (up and down of the box) directions. A small caveat This isn't actually the formal definition of divergence.

Conventionally a positive rotation is counterclockwise. Notice how, just with one number, we can describe 2D rotation in its entirety. In 3D space, rotation is more complex: First we need to consider the axis of rotation. This is where the rotation occurs about. Next, we need to consider the magnitude and direction of the rotation - which is a vector. This is known as the angular velocity, denoted . The convention for the direction of the angular velocity vector is called the right-hand rule. Take your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the rotation.

The curl is a vector that purely exists in the direction. Hence, a prototype for the 3D curl could be, for a vector field : However this does not fully capture the curl, since it only works on a 2D vector field. To generalize this more, we need to do this for a vector field in 3D space. Recall our original vector field : This results, as we've seen, in a vector field that lies on a plane. Consider \"copying\" this vector for every value: Of course, only some of the vectors are visible. In reality, for every value, there is a plane in which the vector field exists.

If you can't find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, then the vectors are linearly independent. Implications of Linear Dependence​ If a set of vectors is linearly dependent, then it means that one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.

For example, consider some GPS software that says \"Go 3 miles north, then 4 miles south.\" This is like saying \"Go , then .\" The two vectors are linearly dependent because you can linearly combine them to get . This means we can describe the north vector in terms of the south vector, or vice versa. Therefore, we can remove one of them without losing any information.

In the future, we will see that treating the derivative as a fraction is very beneficial in many cases, like implicit differentiation, related rates, substitution, separation of variables, and more. However, this notion of the derivative as a fraction is not entirely accurate. In modern mathematics, calculus is built on Analysis, which is the rigorous study of limits and continuity. The derivative, as we've shown, is defined as a limit, not a fraction.

Predator Growth → Prey Decline - The more foxes there are, the more rabbits they eat, so the rabbit population decreases. Prey Decline → Predator Decline - The less rabbits there are, the less food there is for the foxes, so the fox population decreases.

First, consider the numerator: This is equivalent to a certain cross product. The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors and is . Hence: Isn't the cross product a 3D operation? The cross product is indeed a 3D operation, meaning it's only defined for vectors . However, the cross product can be generalized to 2D vectors by considering them as 3D vectors with a -component of 0. Hence, the proper way to write the cross product is: Instead of considering the cross product itself, which has a direction in 3D space, we consider the magnitude of the cross product, which is a scalar, and makes sense in 2D space. We can consider what both and represent visually. Consider a curve of some parametric equation , and consider points on the curve: For every point on the curve, consider a vector pointing there. Then, the first derivative measures the movement in this vector. If you were to do this for all points, then you get the tangent vector. To visualize , consider plotting the tangent vectors separately, placed at the origin. Then, consider the change in these tangent vectors. In essence, the first derivative measures the change in the tip of the vector function, while the second derivative measures the change in the tangent vector. Consider the cross product of these two vectors. To illustrate what it means, consider tangent vectors on a curve with high curvature: Notice how it's almost a rotation as approaches 0. Hence, the acceleration of the tangent vector would approximately be perpendicular to the tangent vector. In other words, the curvature is essentially how perpendicular the acceleration is to the tangent vector. This should make you instantly think of the cross product, which is exactly what the curvature formula is. Recall that geometrically, the magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. As such, if they're more perpendicular, the area is larger, and hence the curvature is higher, which is exactly what the formula evaluates. So, the curvature can be described as: There's a problem, however. Recall that the curvature is defined as the rate of change with respect to arc length, since the curvature is a property of the curve itself, not the parameterization. This would pose a problem to our makeshift formulation of the curvature, since a higher speed would imply a longer tangent vector, which would imply a higher curvature. For instance, if you double the speed, the tangent vector would double in length, and so will the acceleration. We can instead consider \"shrinking\" the tangent vector to a unit vector: However, for the acceleration vector, we divide by the magnitude of the velocity vector, so that it corresponds to the tangent: Recall that the second derivative tells you how much the tangent vector changes, and the first derivative tells you how much the curve changes. If we want to express everything in terms of the tangent vector, we should divide by the magnitude of the tangent vector. Then the cross product of these two vectors is: This is actually equivalent to the derivative of the unit tangent vector with respect to time.

However, it can be visualized in by mapping inputs in a 2D plane to outputs in a 3D space. This results in a surface in 3D space. One common way to make this more convenient is to, instead of using a separate 2D plane, \"override\" the 2D plane into the -plane in 3D space. Start Here, we start with a 2D plane in the -plane, and then transform each point to the output of the function. This is visualized by moving the input plane to form the surface. Next, consider one singular point on the surface, say . This point is visualized by seeing how a point on the input plane is transformed in the output surface. We can evaluate the output of the function at this point: Start Next, recall the partial derivative with respect to : Since the partial derivative with respect to means keeping constant, we can think of a line in the input plane where is constant: Start This visualization gives an idea of how the output of the function changes as changes, while keeping constant. The entire line is essentially a line where is unchanged, whereas varies along the line. For a different constant, you would get a different curve along the surface. For the partial derivative, we visualize it by incrementing by a small amount, and seeing how the output changes.

The transformation has to preserve the structure of the space, which means that it cannot \"tear\" or \"break\" vectors in the process. A result of this is that after applying a linear transformation, the gridlines in the vector space will remain parallel and evenly spaced. This property is crucial in many applications of linear algebra, such as computer graphics, physics, and engineering.

Recall that these line segments are defined in terms of certain vectors and a parameter . So, to transform this whole set, we need to transform each of these vectors and keep the parameter intact. Below is the visualization for the following transformation: Start Before doing the calculation, let's understand this from an intuitive perspective. Notice how, in the transformed space, the line segments are still line segments. Recall that visually, linear transformations preserve line distances and line parallelism. This is a visual representation of that. Additionally, notice how, both in the original and transformed spaces, the line segments are still connected at the endpoints, and the endpoints are the transformed vectors. This means that to create the new set of line segments, we only need to transform the endpoints of the original line segments. Next, let's prove this mathematically. First, apply the transformation to . Using the additivity of linear transformations: Then, using the homogeneity of linear transformations: And using the additivity again: This is known as the image of the line segment under the transformation . Similarly, we can find the image of and under the transformation : Notice what we've done here - we have a set of infinite vectors that span some line segment. Instead of applying the transformation to every single one of these vectors (which is impossible), we've applied the transformation just to the endpoints of the line segment and then used the linearity of the transformation to find the transformation of the entire line segment. This reflects a powerful property of linear transformations which we have already shown many times - you don't need to know how it affects every single vector in the space.","s":"Linear Transformations of Subsets","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations","h":"#linear-transformations-of-subsets","p":1970},{"i":2003,"t":"We've seen how linear transformations affect individual vectors and subsets of vectors.

The coefficient matrix is the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in the system of equations: The coefficient matrix is: We can augment the coefficient matrix with the right-hand side of the equations: It might not be immediately clear why we're doing this - we could've just solved the equations directly. One reason is that it just saves time; we won't have to write , , , and every time. We can apply the same operations to the augmented matrix as we would to the system of equations. For example, we can add a multiple of one row to another, or swap two rows. The leading entry in a row is the first non-zero element in the row. We want to make all leading entries 1, and all other entries in the column 0. Additionally, for every row with a leading 1, all other entries in the column should be 0. For example, this is a matrix that satisfies the conditions: This is called the reduced row-echelon form (RREF) of the matrix. The RREF of a matrix is denoted as . Recall our augmented matrix: We can perform operations on the matrix to get it into RREF. Denote row 1 as , row 2 as , and row 3 as for simplicity. We will iterate through every column to get the matrix into RREF. First, notice that already has a leading 1. Hence, we want to make all other entries in the column 0. This sets the first column in to 0. Next, to set the first column in to 0, we can subtract from : Now, the first column is in RREF. has a leading , so we want to make that instead. This can be achieved simply by multiplying by : To set the third column in to 0, we can add to : We zeroed out , and can now move on to . Replace with : Recall the criteria for RREF: The leading entry in each row is 1. The leading 1 in each row is the only non-zero entry in its column. Our matrix now satisfies these conditions: Some more terminology to note for this matrix: Each leading 1, as the only non-zero entry in its column, is called a pivot entry. The row with all zero entries is known as the zeroed-out row. By convention, in RREF, the zeroed-out row is at the bottom of the matrix. The process we have just done to achieve RREF is called Gaussian elimination. To illustrate how this actually helps us solve the system of equations, let's rewrite the matrix in terms of the variables: The variables associated with the pivot entries are known as pivot variables. In our case, the pivot variables are and . The others are called free variables. Recall that our system of equations had four unknowns, but only three equations, meaning we can't derive exact values for all variables. The free variables are the ones that can take on any value. Rewrite the system of equations in terms of the pivot and free variables: That's the general solution to the system of equations. To help with visualization, we can use a vector to represent the solution: We can write the solution in terms of the free variables: Then, separating the pivot and free variables into separate vectors: Now, the vector point is a linear combination of the free variables.
