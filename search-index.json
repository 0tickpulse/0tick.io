Note that: The discussion around the arguments is not exhaustive; we will not cover all possible objections or counterarguments. The discussion is not meant to \"knock down\" or \"destroy\" the arguments. Instead, it is meant to provide a balanced view of the arguments and their various perspectives. The discussion is also not meant to endorse or promote any particular argument.

Therefore, change is impossible. Aquinas' act-potency distinction allows him to avoid this problem. However, it also leads to some other problems. First, the act of staying the same is also a kind of change, and can be seen as a kind of potentiality. This means that everything has at least one potential, that of staying the same. This \"everything\" includes the unmoved mover, which means that the unmoved mover is not actually unmoved. Second, many philosophers argue that it leads to an actual infinity of potentials. Consider a fluid in a container at . It has the potential to be at , , , and so on - an infinite number of potentials.

This is a more epistemic interpretation. As a relation - this could be causation, or a realization, or a grounding relation. For example, the structure of transistors grounds the structure of a circuit. An object cannot be its own reason for existence, because that would imply that it is prior and posterior to itself. Even in an epistemic sense, it would not make any sense to say \" is true because is true\". This means that must be explained by , and must be explained by , and so on ad infinitum. One way to stop this infinite regress is to construct a causal loop, but this leads to circular reasoning, which is, to a certain extent, a type of self explanation. The next logical question is to ask why the infinite chain exists in the first place. This cannot be explained by any constituent elements in the chain, because the chain itself is the object of explanation. It would not make sense to say \"there are fish in the sea because there is a fish in the sea\". One could posit an explanation for the chain, but that would itself be then part of the chain.

T: i.e. if it is necessary that , then . 5: i.e. if it is possible that , then it is necessary that it is possible that .

Def 2: The Big Conjunctive Fact—BCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Def 3: The Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact—BCCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the contingent propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Some terminology: Compossible means that the propositions can all be true at the same time. Maximal means that there are no other propositions that can be added to the conjunction without making it inconsistent. This means that for any proposition , either or is in the conjunction. Oppy makes a distinction between the weak and strong PSR, noting the primary difference being a proposition \"possibly having an explanation\" or just \"having an explanation\". Then, Oppy writes a paragraph to show that the first premise of the Gale-Pruss argument entails the strong PSR: Suppose that there is a world which is such that the BCF for that world has no explanation in that world. Let the BCF for that world be . Consider the conjunctive proposition: and has no explanation. By hypothesis, this conjunctive proposition is true in .

A personal explanation is one that explains a fact by appealing to the intentions of a person. For instance, to explain why a glass broke, a scientific explanation would involve the laws of physics, while a personal explanation would involve the intentions of a person who broke the glass. Gale and Pruss point out that scientific explanations are generalizations over contingent facts, hence scientific explanations are also contingent and included in the BCCP. Thus the explanation of the BCCP must be a personal explanation, which involves a necessary being. However, this fails to consider one small detail: there are other types of explanations, such as: Metaphysical explanations; one that cites neither intentions nor the evolution of some system or the state of the system at a given time, governed by the laws of nature. For instance, Pruss is an Aristotelian. Aristotelianism posits formal causality, the claim that there are \"forms\" that underlie the existence of things. This form is not a personal agent with intentions causing the various parts to combine, nor is this a scientific explanation. In science, one would not appeal to substantial forms, since it is a metaphysical explanation. Furthermore, it is not governed by \"deterministic or statistical\" laws of nature, and does not deal with some state of affairs. Other examples of metaphysical explanations include the concept of grounding; the structure of DNA is grounded in the laws of chemistry. However, this is not a scientific explanation according to their definition, since it does not involve the state of a system at some time being governed by the laws of nature. Functional realization is another example; things have functions and are realized by certain structures. Part of the reason why something exists is because its constituents realize a certain function. Ethical explanations; these are explanations that involve moral facts.

Additionally, neither the argument nor the paper by Gale and Pruss provide sufficient explanation for the contingency of scientific explanations.

The devil says: I will give you this powerful machine, it will answer any question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up geometry and you will have this marvelous machine.\" Michael Atiyah Since the time of the ancient Greeks, algebra has been a central part of mathematics. It is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra is used in basically every field of mathematics, from number theory to geometry to topology to logic. Although we have already learned a lot of algebra in school, the algebra we learned is only a small part of the vast field of algebra. The algebra we learned in school is called elementary algebra, and it deals with the basic operations of arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Abstract algebra, on the other hand, is a more advanced form of algebra that deals with more abstract mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. These structures are used to study the properties of mathematical objects, such as numbers, vectors, and matrices, in a more general and systematic way. Before we dive into the details of abstract algebra, we need to first establish preliminary concepts and definitions that will be used throughout abstract algebra, such as sets, logic, and proofs.","s":"Abstract Algebra","u":"/notes/maths/Abstract Algebra/Introduction","h":"","p":126},{"i":129,"t":"The first important concept in abstract algebra is how logic and proofs work. In a logical system, we make logical arguments: Start with axioms - these are the basic assumptions that we take to be true. Use logical reasoning to derive theorems - these are the conclusions that we can draw from the axioms. This is known as an axiomatic approach to logic. Axioms are the starting point, and theorems are the conclusions. Note that: Axioms must not contradict each other. Since they are all true, they must all be true at the same time, hence they must be consistent. Axioms must be independent. If one axiom can be derived from the others, then it is not an axiom, but a theorem. A logical system cannot have too many axioms. If there are too many axioms, then the system becomes too complex and restrictive.","s":"Logic and Proofs Quickstart","u":"/notes/maths/Abstract Algebra/Logic and Proofs Quickstart","h":"","p":128},{"i":131,"t":"We need to understand the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning. For deductive reasoning, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be necessarily true. For example: All cats are mammals. Fluffy is a cat. Therefore, Fluffy is a mammal. Note that the premises do not have to be true for the argument to be deductively valid. For example: All cats are amphibians. Fluffy is a cat. Therefore, Fluffy is an amphibian. While premise 1 is false, the argument is still deductively valid. For inductive reasoning, the premises are true, and the conclusion is likely to be true. For example: All cats we have seen are mammals. Therefore, all cats are mammals. Inductive reasoning is not as strong as deductive reasoning, but it is still useful in many contexts. Generally, in science, we use inductive reasoning to make generalizations from specific observations. However, in mathematics, we use deductive reasoning to prove theorems from axioms. The deductive nature of mathematics is what gives it its rigor. It is a precise and structured way of reasoning that allows us to draw conclusions with certainty.","s":"Rigor, Deduction, and Induction","u":"/notes/maths/Abstract Algebra/Logic and Proofs Quickstart","h":"#rigor-deduction-and-induction","p":128},{"i":133,"t":"A statement is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both (law of excluded middle).

It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Since we're considering motion in one dimension, we can represent displacement as a scalar. You can think of displacement as the distance between the starting and ending points of an object's motion. For example, if you have a car that starts at position and ends at position , the displacement is . Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. It tells us how fast an object is moving and in what direction. Velocity is also a vector quantity, but in one dimension, it can be represented as a scalar. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. It tells us how quickly an object's velocity is changing. Acceleration is also a vector quantity, but in one dimension, it can be represented as a scalar. Let's consider motion of a ball in one dimension. Throw a ball up in the air, and let it fall back down. The displacement of the ball at time is given by the function . This can be thought of the height of the ball above where it was thrown. We'll consider the motion of the ball from time to time . According to physics, objects fall under the influence of gravity, which causes them to accelerate downwards at a constant rate, usually denoted by . Therefore, we can write: Next, we can find the velocity of the ball at time by integrating the acceleration function: refers to the initial velocity of the ball, and can be denoted by or . Finally, we can find the displacement of the ball at time by integrating the velocity function: This equation is very common, and because of the expressions , , , , and , it is known as the \"SUVAT\" equations.

The law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Then, students typically study differential calculus, which deals with the study of the rate at which quantities change. This includes topics such as limits, derivatives, and applications of derivatives. After studying differential calculus, students typically study integral calculus, which deals with the accumulation of quantities. This includes topics such as integrals, techniques of integration, and applications of integrals. Finally, students may study multivariable calculus, which extends the concepts of differential and integral calculus to functions of several variables. Calculus 1 and 2 are typically the first two courses in a calculus sequence, and cover the topics of differential and integral calculus, respectively. These courses are typically taken by students in their first or second year of college or university. AP Calculus AB and BC are somewhat equivalent to Calculus 1 and 2, respectively, though there's some differences in the content covered. Calculus 3 is typically the third course in a calculus sequence, and covers the topics of multivariable calculus. This course is typically taken by students in their second or third year of college or university. The notes in this section cover AP Calculus BC, but is written as Calculus 1 and 2, since there will eventually be a Calculus 3 section. There are many topics beyond Calculus 3. Differential Equations are typically studied after Calculus 3, and deal with the study of equations involving derivatives. This includes topics such as first-order differential equations, second-order differential equations, and systems of differential equations. This is important especially in physics and engineering. Linear Algebra is typically studied after Calculus 3, and deals with the study of vectors, vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations. This is important especially in physics, engineering, and computer science. Real Analysis is typically studied after Calculus 3, and goes back to the foundations of calculus, rigorously defining limits, derivatives, and integrals. This is important especially for students who plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics. Complex Analysis is typically studied after Real Analysis, and deals with the study of complex numbers and functions. This is important especially for students who, again, plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics. Partial Differential Equations are typically studied after Differential Equations, and deal with the study of equations involving partial derivatives. There are also some obscure topics in calculus, such as: Functional Analysis, which is the study of infinite-dimensional vector spaces and operators on those spaces.

If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\" G. H. Hardy, 1940 The definition for mathematics is not as clear-cut as one might think. As the study of numbers - this is only partially true. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but also about shapes, patterns, and relationships. Many things deal with non-numerical concepts, such as geometry, topology, logic, and set theory. As a deductive science - this is also only partially true. Mathematical reasoning is not just deductive, but also inductive, sometimes even abductive. Many things deal with inductive reasoning, such as statistics, probability, and combinatorics. Rather than being \"pure\" or \"applied\", mathematics is a spectrum of both, and various fields of mathematics can lie anywhere on this spectrum. As the \"science of formal systems\" (Haskell Curry in 1951) - this does not capture the full essence of mathematics. Mathematics is not just about formal systems, but also about intuition, creativity, and discovery. Pure math without intuition is soulless. However, the definitions aside, there are some common themes in mathematics: Mathematics is about abstracting away the unnecessary details and focusing on the essential properties of objects. The first thing you learn, numbers, are abstractions of the real world. The number 1 is not a physical object; you can't say \"give me 1\". Instead, numbers, are abstractions of counting, and they have properties that are useful in various contexts. One advantage of abstraction is that it allows us to study a wide range of objects with similar properties. For instance, the same differential equations that describe the motion of a pendulum can also describe the flow of heat in a metal rod. Mathematics is logical. It is about making precise arguments and drawing conclusions from them. You start with a set of axioms, which are assumed to be true, and then use logical reasoning to derive theorems. The axioms are the starting point, and the theorems are the conclusions. The process of deriving theorems from axioms is called proof. However, mathematics is not just about proving theorems; estimation, approximation, and conjecture are also important. Mathematics is about patterns and structures. It is about recognizing patterns in the world and using them to build structures. For instance, the Fibonacci sequence is a pattern that appears in many natural phenomena, such as the branching of trees and the arrangement of leaves on a stem. The concept of a group is a structure that appears in many areas of mathematics, such as number theory, geometry, and algebra. Generally, mathematics is a logical, abstract, and creative discipline that studies the world in a precise and structured way.","s":"Introduction to Mathematics","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"","p":463},{"i":466,"t":"As previously mentioned, mathematics mixes together intuition and formulation. The intuition is the visual and intuitive interpretation of the concept, while the formulation is the more formal description that shows how the concept can be generalized and computed. The general discovery process for mathematics is; Specific Example → Intuition → Mathematical Model → Wide-Ranging Applications This shows the advantage of abstraction. By abstracting things into their fundamental properties, we can apply the same concepts to a wide range of problems. For instance, when Newton was studying the motion of the planets, he developed the concept of calculus to describe the motion of objects in general. Today, calculus is used everywhere, from physics to economics to computer science to just about every field you can think of. One shortcoming of the modern education system is that it usually does this process in reverse. It starts with the formulation. This is probably partly responsible for the large distaste for mathematics.

These are just a few of the many branches of mathematics. Each branch has its own set of concepts, techniques, and applications, yet they are all interconnected in some way. Another way to categorize mathematics is by its level of abstraction: Pure mathematics, which studies abstract concepts and structures for their own sake. Applied mathematics, which uses mathematical tools and techniques to solve real-world problems. Pure and applied mathematics are not mutually exclusive; they are two ends of a spectrum. Many areas of mathematics lie somewhere in between, using abstract concepts to solve practical problems.

For example, if we graph the function for , we get: When visualizing parametric equations, you can think of the input as time. Then, you sort-of trace out the path of the function as time progresses. Note that when doing this, input information is lost - you can't tell what the input was at any given point, only where the function was at that time.

Our observation has two parts: The shadow of the pencil is always less than or equal to the length of the pencil. Turning this into a logical statement, we have: This means that the dot product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes: Notice that we have taken the absolute value of the dot product, since we are only interested in the length of the projection, which is always positive. The shadow of the pencil is at most the length of the pencil when the pencil is flat on the table. This means that the dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes when the vectors are parallel: This means that the dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes when the vectors are parallel.

If you multiply a vector on the line by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie on the line, since the direction of the vector does not change.

It can represent something's position, velocity, or some force acting on it. This is the most intuitive interpretation of a vector. These vectors are often represented as arrows in space, where the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector: To a programmer, a vector is just a list of numbers. It could be used to represent a point in space, but it could also represent other things. For example, very commonly, we can represent a color as a vector. All colors can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, so a color can be represented as a vector with three components. We hence call this vector three-dimensional. Vectors can also be used to represent other things that do not have to do with space. You could have a three-dimensional vector representing a person's age, height, and weight for example. These also apply in scientific studies. For instance, given a chemical reaction, we can represent each reactant and product as a separate component in a vector. In a reaction with 3 reactants and 2 products, we can represent the reaction as a 5-dimensional vector. Another example is in mathematics itself, where we can represent a polynomial as a list of its coefficients. To a mathematician, a vector is a member of a vector space. This is a more abstract definition, but it is the most general. A vector can be anything that has the notion of addition and multiplication defined on it. We will go into detail about this later.

However, note that the starting point of the vector is arbitrary. It can be more helpful to think of the vector as an \"instruction\" to move from the tail to the tip. If you imagine the -axis as east and the -axis as north, then the vector is an instruction to move 2 units east and 1 unit north.

For example, when studying integration, we can rigorously prove the existence of definite integrals and explore the properties of integrable functions. Real refers to the real numbers. This means that in real analysis, we are primarily concerned with functions defined on the real number line. This also means that there are other types of analysis, such as complex analysis, which deal with functions defined on the complex plane. So, in essence, real analysis is the study of functions defined on the real numbers, with a focus on the theoretical underpinnings of concepts like limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration.","s":"What Exactly is Real Analysis?","u":"/notes/maths/Real Analysis/Introduction","h":"#what-exactly-is-real-analysis","p":750},{"i":756,"t":"Categorizes algorithms on time/memory based on input.","s":"Big-O Notation","u":"/notes/programming/DSA/Big-O Notation","h":"","p":755},{"i":758,"t":"Helps us make decisions on what data structures and algorithms to use.","s":"Why?","u":"/notes/programming/DSA/Big-O Notation","h":"#why","p":755},{"i":760,"t":"As input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?","s":"Fundamental concept","u":"/notes/programming/DSA/Big-O Notation","h":"#fundamental-concept","p":755},{"i":763,"t":"fn sum_char_codes(input: String) -> u32 { let mut i = 0; for char in input.chars() { i += char as u32; } i } It runs an iteration in the for loop for the length of the string.

Philosophers like John Locke (1632 - 1704) and Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796) pushed the concept of empiricism which posits that knowledge comes from one's experience. This was in contrast to rationalism, which posited that knowledge comes from reason. In the 19th century, physiological studies began investigating the human sensory systems. German philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 - 1894) measured the speed of nerve impulses and the speed of sound, and eventually, he came to the conclusion that senses are not infallible. This means that the senses can be fooled; that is, there is a psychological reality that is separate from the physical reality. While this was not a new idea, it was a new way of thinking about the senses. Helmholtz's work suggests that despite the fallibility of the senses, we can still use science to measure and understand the mind. This relationship between physical and psychological reality was studied by German researchers like Gustav Fechner (1801 - 1887) and Ernst Weber (1795 - 1878) in what's known as psychophysics. German physician Wilhelm Wundt (1832 - 1920) is often credited with establishing the first psychology laboratory in 1879. He: First strongly promoted the idea of psychology as an experimental science. Provided classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for students to study psychology. (1875) joined the University of Leipzig as a professor, making plans to establish a course in experimental psychology. (1879) established the first laboratory experience - usually considered the birth of psychology as a science. Wundt's work received great responses with students from all over the world coming to study under him. They were trained on various psychological experiments like: Introspection - the process of looking inward to examine one's own thoughts and feelings. Consciousness - the awareness of internal and external stimuli. Mental Chronometry - the study of reaction time.

He focused on the adult human mind, but excluded children, animals, and people with mental illnesses from his studies. This \"flavor\" of experimental psychology was popular in the United States, and it was taught in many universities. The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892, but Titchener thought it did not represent experimental psychology well. This led him to found the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1904. This society did not welcome women.

Where as Titchener was more reductionist, functionalists were more interested in the function of the mind. James states that consciousness is continuous and always changing, and that it cannot be broken down into smaller components. James wrote the most famous psychology textbook of the time, The Principles of Psychology (1890), and also became a professor at Harvard University.

Evolution broadly refers to the gradual change in heritable characteristics within a population over time. Natural selection, on the other hand, is a key mechanism driving evolution. It describes the differential survival and reproductive success of individuals possessing traits that make them better suited to their environment. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that evolution is not synonymous with progress. It is not a linear process culminating in the production of more complex or \"advanced\" organisms. Rather, it is a dynamic, non-directional process, with no inherent goal or endpoint. The evolutionary process is contingent upon the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and reproductive success. An important concept in evolution is that of a species. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Humans are, for instance, homo sapiens. Over time, species can change. This is called speciation. Speciation is the process by which new species are formed. It occurs when a group of individuals becomes isolated from the rest of the population. Over time, the isolated group may evolve into a new species.

Oxygen in the atmosphere is almost entirely attributable to photosynthesis: While initial life forms were exclusively anaerobic, the oxygenation of the atmosphere proved toxic, selectively driving the evolution of aerobic organisms - including ourselves, for whom oxygen is now an existential necessity.

This theory works well for objects that are not too small or moving too fast, hence \"everyday\" scales. Problems in classical mechanics are solved primarily by Newton's laws (or by the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, which are more general and can be applied to more complex systems). By the 20th century, classical mechanics was well understood and was considered a \"complete\" theory. However, it was soon discovered that classical mechanics was not sufficient to explain a variety of phenomena, which is why new theories were developed. At very small scales, we have quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum mechanics is based on waves and probabilities, and it is used to describe the behavior of particles like electrons and photons. Quantum mechanics is a very successful theory and has been tested extensively in experiments. At very high speeds, we have special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. From noticing that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames (because its value is based on two fundamental constants), Einstein made a series of postulates that led to the development of special relativity. Special relativity has many interesting consequences, such as time dilation and length contraction. At very large scales, we have general relativity, which describes the behavior of objects with very strong gravitational fields. Originally, due to a discrepancy between the predictions of Newtonian gravity and the observed orbit of Mercury, Einstein developed general relativity. It describes gravity not as a Newtonian force, but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. General relativity has been tested in many ways and has passed all tests so far. In fact, even the acceleration of the universe's expansion, which Einstein initially thought was a mistake in his equations, was later confirmed by observations. Electricity and Magnetism are part of classical physics. Outside of gravity, they are the forces that keep our lives on Earth running. All matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The interactions between these charges are what give rise to electricity and magnetism. This means that all of chemistry, biology, and even the functioning of our brains are based on the principles of electricity and magnetism. In fact, even the light that we see is an electromagnetic wave - the result of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. There are four equations that describe all of classical electromagnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. They are based on the work of many scientists, including Gauss, Ampère, and Faraday, but were first written down in their modern form by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. Maxwell's equations are: Here, is the electric field, and is the magnetic field. A large part of classical electromagnetism is understanding how these fields interact with each other and with charges and currents. Eventually, we will see that these fields can be combined into a single field, known as the electromagnetic field, which is described by a single tensor.

This involves the concept of the electric field, as well as Gauss's law, which is the first of Maxwell's equations. Magnetostatics: We will then move on to magnetic fields and potentials in static situations. This is similar to electrostatics, but with a few key differences, since the magnetic force acts a bit differently from the electric force. Electrodynamics: We will then combine electric and magnetic fields to study how they interact with each other and with moving charges.

All matter possesses charge, and it is responsible for the electromagnetic interactions between particles. Classical physics assumes that charge is continuous; that is, it can take on any value. Of course, we know that all charge in the universe is quantized in units of the elementary charge . However, the principles of classical physics still hold to an enormous degree of accuracy. The elementary charge is so small () that in most macroscopic situations, charge appears continuous. The second assumption is that charge distribution is continuous. This means that charge is spread out over a volume, and we can talk about the charge \"density\" at any point in space. Once again, we know that at a microscopic level, charge distribution is not continuous, rather there are particles with discrete charges that make up matter. This is not to say that classical electromagnetism does not study the interactions between individual charges. In fact, the entire field of electrostatics is built on the interactions between individual charges. We will see how Coulomb's Law, the most fundamental law of electrostatics, describes the force between two individual point charges. This is also not to say that classical electromagnetism is not useful; it is actually increasingly important in modern physics. Why? The Theory of Relativity does not change the laws of electromagnetism. In fact, the Theory of Relativity was developed to make electromagnetism consistent with the laws of physics. Quantum Mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, only deviates from classical physics in extreme situations. These situations are so small - ( times smaller than an atom) - that they are not relevant to most macroscopic situations. In fact, we can discuss the behavior of atoms and molecules using classical electromagnetism with great accuracy. In the case that quantum effects are important, a field called quantum electrodynamics is used, which is a quantum mechanical theory of electromagnetism.","s":"Classical View of Charge","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Thinking about Charge","h":"#classical-view-of-charge","p":947},{"i":954,"t":"It was experimentally discovered that there are two types of charge, where same charges repel and opposite charges attract. To make it mathematically convenient, we call one type of charge positive and the other negative. As current models suggest, any particle with a charge also has an antiparticle with the exact same properties, just with an opposite charge. This means that there are also antiprotons and positrons, which have negative and positive charges, respectively. Particles and their antiparticles can annihilate each other, releasing energy in the form of photons. This energy is what we see in particle accelerators, where particles are smashed together at high speeds to create new particles and study their properties. In the early universe, when the temperature was high enough, particles and antiparticles were created in equal amounts. Due to some unknown asymmetry in the laws of physics, there was a slight excess of particles over antiparticles. This excess of particles is what makes up all the matter in the universe today. The asymmetry in the laws of physics that caused this excess is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics. The majority of positive charge in the universe is in the form of protons, while the majority of negative charge is in the form of electrons. In an atom, the protons are concentrated in the center, forming the nucleus, while the electrons are spread out in orbitals around the nucleus. The electrons are held in place by the electromagnetic force between the positive protons and the negative electrons. Note that while protons are positive and electrons are negative, this assignment of charge signs is arbitrary. In fact, the assignment of charge signs was done before the discovery of the electron. All charge in the universe is a multiple of the elementary charge . Protons have a charge of , electrons have a charge of , and neutrons have no charge. Protons are part of a class of particles called hadrons, and they have an internal structure made up of three quarks. Namely, a proton is made up of two up quarks (each with a charge of ) and one down quark (with a charge of ). If, then, an isolated quark exists, it would violate the quantization of charge. However, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) prevents the existence of isolated quarks. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we will mostly ignore the quantization of charge in classical electromagnetism. Instead, we act like a charge, , can take on any value, and we can talk about the charge density at any point in space. The charge density can be thought of as an \"average\" charge per unit volume, in the same way that mass density is the \"average\" mass per unit volume. We will also treat the particles simply as point charges. Experiments have shown that protons and electrons are much smaller than the smallest distances we can measure, so treating them as point charges is a good approximation.","s":"The Charge in Matter","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Thinking about Charge","h":"#the-charge-in-matter","p":947},{"i":956,"t":"Charge, like many other quantities in physics, is conserved.

(This will be a highly contentious point in the future when we discuss the invariance of charge.) Note that this does not mean that charge is always equal in all parts of a system. For example, in a circuit, charge can flow from one part of the circuit to another, even though the total charge in the circuit remains constant. Another example is a photon's ability to create an electron-positron pair, which, although it changes the charge of the system, does not violate the conservation of charge because the photon itself carries no charge. Conservation laws, such as the conservation of charge, are fundamental to physics. Some advanced mathematical theories, such as Noether's theorem, show that conservation laws actually arise from certain symmetries in the universe.

There are also semiconductors and superconductors, but for the purposes of this introduction, we simplify things by ignoring them. In a conductor, electrons can move freely. In an insulator, they cannot. This is due to the structure of the material. For instance, -block metals have a \"sea of electrons\" that can move freely, while covalent bonds in insulators hold electrons in place. This is why metals like copper are good conductors, while plastics are good insulators. However, insulators also have usages in electronics.

The electric field is a vector field that describes the force that a charge would experience at any point in space. This field exists everywhere in space just like the gravitational field. In the diagram above, the green arrows represent the electric field. The blue arrow represents a test charge. (You need to move the green point a bit for the field to render properly due to a bug.) A test charge is a charge that is so small that it does not affect the electric field. It is used to measure the electric field at a point. Technically, test charges don't exist. However, they are a useful concept for understanding the electric field. Move the blue point around. You would notice that the force on the test charge changes as it moves around. Mathematically, the electric field at a point is given by: Where: is the electric field. is the force on a test charge. is the magnitude of the test charge. hence has units of force per charge, or . As a vector field, the electric field has both magnitude and direction. If the charge is positive, the field points away from the charge. If the charge is negative, the field points towards the charge. If you take the magnitude of the electric field, it can be simplified to: In practice, it is often easier to just get the magnitude and then conceptually find the direction.","s":"Electric Field","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Very Ancient Electromagnetism Notes","h":"#electric-field","p":959},{"i":974,"t":"The electric field is a vector field, so it can be added together.

The -component of the field would be , and the -components cancel out. Since cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, we can use trigonometry to find the field at the point above the plate. Now we do this in 2D: instead of two points, we imagine a ring of radius and thickness on the plate.

Now, notice that as the distance from the patch to the charge increases, (1) the electric field decreases by and (2) the area increases by . This means that they cancel out, and the flux through the new surface will be the same as the flux through the sphere. As such, for any surface enclosing a charge, the electric flux through the surface is . This is known as Gauss's Law: Gauss's Law, Integral Form: For any closed surface enclosing a charge , the electric flux through the surface is given by: For charges outside the surface, the flux through the surface is zero. The reason for this is that while the field lines pass through the surface, eventually the same amount of field lines will also exit the surface.

Let's say we are interested in the value of near , and we want to approximate it with a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic function). Denote the quadratic function as . Play around with the sliders below to see how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients a_0, a_1, and a_2: Options Consider how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients , , and . The goal is to find the coefficients that make as close as possible to near . First, consider evaluated at : We want the value of to be the same as at . Hence, one of the coefficients is already determined. Changing the other coefficients will affect the function but will not change the value of . Next, we want the slope of to be the same as the slope of at . This ensures that the value of is close to not only at but also in the neighborhood of ; it doesn't drift too far away from . Now, both the position and the slope of are locked as the same as at . The only thing left is to make sure the concavity of is the same as the concavity of at . Now we have found the coefficients , , and . The quadratic functoin is then: The quadratic function is a good approximation of near . As we add more terms to the polynomial, we can get even closer to the original function. For example, we can add two more terms to get a degree 4 polynomial: The coefficients and can be determined in a similar way as we did for . We take the third and fourth derivatives of at and set them equal to the corresponding derivatives of at . Notice what happens when we take the third derivative of the term in : Notice we are multiplying by by by . This is the same as taking the factorial of : Recall that we want this to be equal to the third derivative of at . Thus: And as such, we can solve for : We get a similar result for : Thus, the degree 4 polynomial approximation of is: Notice that adding the higher degree term does not affect the previous terms. For instance, the concavity of is still the same as the concavity of at . Why? When we take the derivative of a term with a higher power of , the power of decreases by one. The concavity is the second derivative, so the power of decreases by two - so it doesn't become a constant term. Recall that we set . As such, if there is an term in the polynomial, it will be multiplied by zero, and the term will disappear. Hence, each individual coefficient is the \"control\" for a specific order derivative of the function. For a value of near , the polynomial is a good approximation of . Next, consider approximating with a polynomial near some value . Then, the polynomial would be written as: Instead of , we use as the variable, such that the point is treated like . This means that if you plug in , things will cancel. We can keep adding more terms to the polynomial to get a better approximation of near a value of . The derivatives of follow a pattern of at . As such, the coefficients of the polynomial will follow a similar pattern: Next, we can generalize this to any function : And to any value : We have just derived the Taylor series for any function centered at . This can be written in sigma notation as: When , this is called the Maclaurin series. What's interesting is that we only need to know the value of the function and its derivatives at a single point to approximate the function at any other point around it.","s":"Taylor and Maclaurin Series","u":"/notes/maths/Calculus 1 and 2/Infinite Series Part 2","h":"#taylor-and-maclaurin-series","p":1004},{"i":1012,"t":"There's a deep connection between the Taylor series and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

If you set as the mass, you could measure the rate of change of mass, , to determine how much fluid is leaking out. Now, let's consider a vector field that represents the flow of a fluid. The vector field could represent the velocity of the fluid at any point in space. If we have a closed curve in space, can we predict how much fluid is flowing outwards through the curve? This quantity is known as the flux of the vector field through the curve . Denoted as , the flux is a scalar quantity that represents the flow of the vector field through the curve.

Since the patch is an area, it scales as the square of the distance from the origin. Therefore: This is not quite right, as the area also changes based on how you tilt .

This means that purely logically, we can derive any result in electrostatics using these two principles. To demosntrate this, we will now solve some a basic problem involving Coulomb's Law and the electric field. There are two goals for basic problems problems like this: To understand how to apply Coulomb's Law and the formula for the electric field to solve problems. To realize that this is a f***ing pain in the a** and we need a better way to do this. The problem is as follows: A solid sphere of radius has a charge uniformly distributed throughout its surface. Find the electric field at a point that is units above the center of the sphere. You will need to use the cosine rule to solve this problem. You will end up with two cases, one where the point is inside the sphere and one where the point is outside the sphere. To solve this problem, we will need to integrate the electric field over the entire surface of the sphere. We shall use spherical coordinates to simplify the calculation. We shall consider a small surface element on the sphere, then use the surface charge density to calculate the charge in this element. The charge density is the charge per unit area, i.e. how much charge is present per unit area of the surface. Since it is uniformly distributed, the charge density is constant and equal to: The surface element is a small patch on the sphere shown below: The area of this surface element is its width times its height, which is . Therefore, the charge in this surface element is: This charge contributes to the electric field at the point . Call this contribution . The key idea is that the contribution is only along the radial (vertical) direction. This is due to the symmetry of the sphere, which means that there is another point, , on the opposite side of the sphere that contributes an equal and opposite electric field in the horizontal direction. A diagram of this is shown below: So we only need to consider the vertical component of the electric field; . To find this component, we need: The charge in the surface element. We already know this to be . The distance from the surface element to the point . We do not know this yet. (I use instead of since looks weird in .) We can construct a triangle with the surface element, the point , and the center of the sphere. This triangle is shown below: We can now find the distance using the cosine rule. (Recall that is the angle from the vertical axis to the point .) With this, we can find the electric field at the point due to the surface element. Remember that only the vertical component of the electric field contributes to the electric field at . We shall use for simplicity. The total electric field at the point is then the sum of the electric fields due to all the surface elements. This is an integral over the entire surface of the sphere. The bounds are and . The angle is the angle between the electric field and the vertical axis. From the cosine rule on we have: To simplify the integral, we can make the subject instead of . By the cosine rule and implicit differentiation, we have: Now, regarding the bounds of the integral, we can visualize from to . (You could calculate the bounds with brute force, but this is a more elegant way to do it.) At , the charge is at the top of the sphere. The diagram below shows for both and : Evidently, the bounds are and . (For , the lower bound of is , while for , the lower bound is .) The upper bound is for both cases: Using both equations, we can rewrite the integral as: From here, it depends on whether or . For , we have : Recall that for a point charge at a distance from the center of the sphere, the electric field is . So the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , we have : So the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Our conclusions are: For , the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Notice how absolutely painful this was. We had to do a complicated spherical integral, and then we had to use a bunch of trigonometry to simplify the result. Any algebraic mistake would have resulted in a wrong answer. And this is all just for a simple sphere with a uniform charge distribution. Imagine doing this for a more complex charge distribution. There is a far better way to do this, and that is by using Gauss' Law. In fact, Gauss' Law is so powerful that a person could probably solve this problem completely mentally.

The electric field due from a continuous charge distribution can be found by integrating the electric field due to each charge element over the entire distribution.

Consider the following vector field: Start In this case, the water is flowing out of the region. In this case, the divergence is positive.

Next, consider the following vector field: Start We flipped the vector field, so now the water is flowing into the region, and the divergence is negative. Regions where the divergence is negative are called sinks. In the water example, the sink could be a drain. Of course, this is not how water works in real life. Going back to the first example: Start Notice that at any region, there's no net flow of water. The water is flowing out of the region as much as it is flowing into the region.

Meaning, it increases as we move to the right. This can be written as: The second scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the right, and some water flowing in from the left. Recall that the divergence is still positive: Notice that the slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. The last scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the left, and some water flowing in from the right. The slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. In this case, it's very negative at the left, and at the right, it is still negative, but less so. Hence, It should be clear from these scenarios that: Hence, the partial derivative is somehow related to the divergence. We can apply the same logic for the component of the vector field: In this case, the water will only flow vertically. Consider the case where the divergence is positive: Now combine the two components: The divergence of this vector field is then defined as the sum of the partial derivatives of the components: There is something interesting about this formula. We only considered vector fields purely in the and directions. In reality, vector fields can be in any direction. The formula for divergence still holds, since the vectors can always be decomposed into components in the and directions. To use the intuitive example, you could consider a box around the origin, and consider the flow of water in and out of the box. Then, the flow can be decomposed into the (left and right of the box) and (up and down of the box) directions. A small caveat This isn't actually the formal definition of divergence.

Conventionally a positive rotation is counterclockwise. Notice how, just with one number, we can describe 2D rotation in its entirety. In 3D space, rotation is more complex: First we need to consider the axis of rotation. This is where the rotation occurs about. Next, we need to consider the magnitude and direction of the rotation - which is a vector. This is known as the angular velocity, denoted . The convention for the direction of the angular velocity vector is called the right-hand rule. Take your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the rotation.

With this, we can plot some vectors representing the curl alongside the vector field: Notice that in areas of clockwise rotation, the curl is negative (points in the direction), and in areas of counterclockwise rotation, the curl is positive (points in the direction). The curl is a vector that purely exists in the direction. Hence, a prototype for the 3D curl could be, for a vector field : However this does not fully capture the curl, since it only works on a 2D vector field. To generalize this more, we need to do this for a vector field in 3D space. Recall our original vector field : This results, as we've seen, in a vector field that lies on a plane. Consider \"copying\" this vector for every value: Of course, only some of the vectors are visible. In reality, for every value, there is a plane in which the vector field exists. Thus, the vector field can be thought of as a volume in 3D space: We have: Added a third input to the vector field, .

Consider the Laplacion of this scalar field: If we plot the scalar field , it doesn't look like a straight line, but it is a harmonic function: To show why this is harmonic, consider the single-variable case again: In a point where , the function is concave up. This means that the points around it are higher than the point itself. Even in a situation where the function has a positive slope: While there are points that are lower than the point itself, on average, the points around it are higher. Next, generalize this to a scalar field. If the Laplacian is nonzero, then it means that around the point, its neighbors are higher/lower than the point itself on average: If the Laplacian is positive (), then the neighbors are higher than the point itself on average. If the Laplacian is negative (), then the neighbors are lower than the point itself on average. The function we have is harmonic; the Laplacian is zero. This means that on average, the point's neighbors are at the same height as the point itself. Laplacians come up in many areas of physics, and this concept of the neighbors' height does have physical significance. For example, if you were considering heat flow, then you would consider the heat around the point to evaluate how the heat is distributed.

A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. For example, consider the vectors: The third vector can be written as a linear combination of the first two vectors: Another way to think of it is, you can make a combination of the three vectors that equals the zero vector: If you can find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, then the vectors are linearly dependent. If you can't find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, then the vectors are linearly independent. Implications of Linear Dependence​ If a set of vectors is linearly dependent, then it means that one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. This means that one of the vectors is redundant, and you can remove it without losing any information. For example, consider some GPS software that says \"Go 3 miles north, then 4 miles south.\" This is like saying \"Go , then .\" The two vectors are linearly dependent because you can linearly combine them to get . This means we can describe the north vector in terms of the south vector, or vice versa. Therefore, we can remove one of them without losing any information. The GPS can instead simply say \"Go 1 mile south.\" Consider another instruction: \"Go 2 miles north, then 2 miles east.\" This is like saying \"Go , then .\" These two vectors are linearly independent because you can't combine them to get . We cannot describe the north vector in terms of the east vector, or vice versa. This means that both vectors are necessary to describe the movement. The GPS can also say \"Go 2.8 miles northeast.\" This would be a linear combination of the two vectors. Linear Dependence to Determine Span​ If you have a set of vectors and you want to determine if they span a space, you can check if they are linearly independent. If they are linearly independent, then they span , and if not, they don't. Proof Let be vectors in the vector space . Assume that . This means that there exists a vector in that is not in .

Now, move them halfway together. Then, move them halfway again. You can keep doing this forever, but you'll never actually touch your hands together.

Since both the numerator and denominator are integers, the sum of rational numbers is rational; . But the sum of the series above evaluates to , which is irrational.

The most famous predator-prey model is the Lotka-Volterra model. Let be the population of foxes (predators) and be the population of rabbits (prey). We can think of the interactions between the two species as follows: Prey Abundance → Predator Growth - The more rabbits there are, the more food there is for the foxes, so the fox population increases. Predator Growth → Prey Decline - The more foxes there are, the more rabbits they eat, so the rabbit population decreases. Prey Decline → Predator Decline - The less rabbits there are, the less food there is for the foxes, so the fox population decreases. Predator Decline → Prey Abundance - The less foxes there are, the less rabbits are eaten, so the rabbit population increases. So it sort of follows a cyclic pattern. We can create a system of two DEs to describe this. Let's consider the DE for the fox population first. The rate of change of the fox population is proportional to the rabbit population (Prey Abundance → Predator Growth), as well as the fox population itself (Offspring). However, foxes can also die due to natural causes, competition, or other predators, so we can introduce a term that dampens the growth rate. As such, the DE for the fox population is: Where represents growth from offspring and predation and represents death from external causes. Next, let's consider the DE for the rabbit population. It undergoes natural exponential growth proportional to its current population. Just like foxes, the growth rate gets dampened by its own population. However, since rabbits are prey, the growth rate is also dampened by the fox population. The DE for the rabbit population is: Where represents growth from offspring and represents death from predation.

The transformation has to preserve the structure of the space, which means that it cannot \"tear\" or \"break\" vectors in the process. A result of this is that after applying a linear transformation, the gridlines in the vector space will remain parallel and evenly spaced.

One reason is that it just saves time; we won't have to write , , , and every time. We can apply the same operations to the augmented matrix as we would to the system of equations. For example, we can add a multiple of one row to another, or swap two rows. The leading entry in a row is the first non-zero element in the row.

First, consider the numerator: This is equivalent to a certain cross product. The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors and is . Hence: Isn't the cross product a 3D operation? The cross product is indeed a 3D operation, meaning it's only defined for vectors . However, the cross product can be generalized to 2D vectors by considering them as 3D vectors with a -component of 0. Hence, the proper way to write the cross product is: Instead of considering the cross product itself, which has a direction in 3D space, we consider the magnitude of the cross product, which is a scalar, and makes sense in 2D space. We can consider what both and represent visually. Consider a curve of some parametric equation , and consider points on the curve: For every point on the curve, consider a vector pointing there. Then, the first derivative measures the movement in this vector. If you were to do this for all points, then you get the tangent vector. To visualize , consider plotting the tangent vectors separately, placed at the origin. Then, consider the change in these tangent vectors. In essence, the first derivative measures the change in the tip of the vector function, while the second derivative measures the change in the tangent vector. Consider the cross product of these two vectors. To illustrate what it means, consider tangent vectors on a curve with high curvature: Notice how it's almost a rotation as approaches 0. Hence, the acceleration of the tangent vector would approximately be perpendicular to the tangent vector. In other words, the curvature is essentially how perpendicular the acceleration is to the tangent vector. This should make you instantly think of the cross product, which is exactly what the curvature formula is. Recall that geometrically, the magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. As such, if they're more perpendicular, the area is larger, and hence the curvature is higher, which is exactly what the formula evaluates. So, the curvature can be described as: There's a problem, however. Recall that the curvature is defined as the rate of change with respect to arc length, since the curvature is a property of the curve itself, not the parameterization. This would pose a problem to our makeshift formulation of the curvature, since a higher speed would imply a longer tangent vector, which would imply a higher curvature. For instance, if you double the speed, the tangent vector would double in length, and so will the acceleration. We can instead consider \"shrinking\" the tangent vector to a unit vector: However, for the acceleration vector, we divide by the magnitude of the velocity vector, so that it corresponds to the tangent: Recall that the second derivative tells you how much the tangent vector changes, and the first derivative tells you how much the curve changes. If we want to express everything in terms of the tangent vector, we should divide by the magnitude of the tangent vector.

In the visualization, the increment is shown by a vector, and you can see the change in the output by seeing how the vector gets transformed: Start Before the transformation, the vector represents the nudge in , . After the transformation, it represents the change in the output, . Taking the ratio, you get , and as , it becomes . The magnitude of the output-change vector represents the magnitude of the derivative, i.e. how fast you are moving along the curve. Using the above visualization, we can intuitively guess what the partial derivative is. By playing the animation and looking at the direction of the vector, we can see that it is pointing in the , , and directions. Hence, the partial derivative at the point is: We can now compute the partial derivative with respect to at this point: This aligns with the intuition we had from the visualization. Likewise, we can find the partial derivative with respect to by keeping constant: Plugging in the values at : The visualization for both partial derivatives is shown below: Start Hopefully this provides an intuitive understanding of how partial derivatives work for parametric surfaces beyond just the algebraic manipulation.","s":"Partial Derivatives of Parametric Surfaces","u":"/notes/maths/Calculus 3/Extending the Derivative Part 1","h":"#partial-derivatives-of-parametric-surfaces","p":1886},{"i":1945,"t":"Another way to express a vector-valued function is as a vector field. Recall that a vector field is a function that assigns a vector to each point in space. For instance, consider the following vector field: This vector field can be visualized by plotting the vectors at each point in the -plane: Consider a point in the space, . The vector at this point is: Consider the partial derivative of this vector field with respect to : Recall that we can conceptualize the partial derivative as the rate of change of the vector field as changes, while keeping constant. We increment by a small amount, and see how the vector field changes, and keep decreasing the increment until it becomes infinitesimally small. Incrementing in this case means moving in the direction in the field, and drawing a new vector at that point: To find the difference in the output, the first step is to put the two vectors in a new space such that they are both at the origin: One way to think about this is that: As , the ratio of to becomes the partial derivative: One way to further conceptualize this is to treat each output component as a separate scalar function: Where: We can write each component's respective partial derivative: Next, once again, consider the point .

We showed that the partial derivative is the derivative of a function with respect to one of its variables, while keeping the other variables constant: We introduced these concepts for scalar-valued functions: Gradient: A vector of partial derivatives of a scalar function. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest increase of the function. Directional Derivative: The rate of change of a function in a certain direction: Where is a unit vector. Using this we can show that the directional derivative is maximized when is in the direction of the gradient: Where is the angle between the gradient and . Multivariable Chain Rule: The chain rule for functions of multiple variables. For a function : We also introduced these concepts for vector-valued functions: Curvature: The rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. The curvature of a curve is: Where is the unit tangent vector. In 2D Cartesian coordinates, the curvature is: Partial Derivatives of Parametric Surfaces: The partial derivatives of a vector-valued function with respect to its parameters.
