Act: What things are in actuality. Potency: What things can potentially be. Parmenides, a pre-Socratic philosopher, argued that change is impossible. He argued that ex nihilo nihil fit, or \"out of nothing, nothing comes\". In his view, change would require a being to come from nothing. But because ex nihilo nihil fit, this is impossible. Aristotle, however, argued against this. Instead of viewing change as a being coming from nothing, he viewed change as a being turning from potency to act. For example, a seed has the potential to become a tree, and when it grows into a tree, it actualizes this potential. Potency is then the middle ground between non-being and being. Both are conceived as \"modes\" of being, so they are all real. To convince yourself of this, consider this: a seed can become a tree, but it also can become a dog. Clearly, one of them seems more \"real\" than the other, suggesting that something about being a tree is more \"real\" than being a dog. However, this distinction is at best unmotivated, and at worst incoherent: This distinction is incompatible with eternalism. The A-theory of time is the view that time is a series of moments. Up until recently, this was the dominant view of time, and is probably what most people intuitively think of when they think of time. In this view, the present is the only real moment, and the past and future are not real. Eternalism, or the B-theory of time, is the view that all times are equally real. Instead of thinking of time as a series of moments, we can think of time as a four-dimensional block. Modern physics, especially general and special relativity, seems to support this view. The problem arises when we consider Aquinas' argument in the context of eternalism. If all times are equally real, then change would not be some \"actualization of potential\". Instead, change is just a variance in an object along the time dimension. At all times, the object is equally real and \"actual\". The distinction also does not solve Parmenides' problem. In Parmenides' view, for example, a seed becoming a tree would involve the tree not existing at time , and then existing at time . This is the problem of coming from nothing, and hence change is impossible. If we introduce the distinction then, the actual tree still does not exist at time ; it's not real. What's the difference? The distinction presupposes pluralism about being. Aquinas' argument seems to rely on a kind of pluralism, suggesting that there are different kinds of beings. This is a controversial view, and many philosophers reject it.","s":"Act-Potency Distinction","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Aquinas First Way","h":"#act-potency-distinction","p":52},{"i":58,"t":"The second premise, that everything in motion is moved by something else, entails a principle of existential inertia.

The first domino contains the causal power in respect to movement, and the other dominoes have this power derived from the first domino. This does not mean, however, that this first cause is necessarily uncaused. This first cause might be unactualized in one respect, but perfectly able to actualize in another respect. For example, the first domino could be unactualized in respect to movement, but perfectly able to actualize in respect to heat. Second, this is the more obvious objection: the argument does not necessarily lead to the traditional conception of God. Naturalists can accept the existence of a first cause, but they would not accept that this first cause is God. For example, they could accept a collection of physical symbols, like quarks or strings, or some quantum field or universal wavefunction, or an initial singularity.

Premise 1 - Contingent beings failed to exist at some point. Being \"able\" to fail to exist is not the same as actually failing to exist. The being could have been present eternally, but still be contingent. An alternative interpretation is that contingent beings have a natural tendency towards decay and non-existence. The problem is that this still does not imply that they actually failed to exist at some point.

For example, a table is a composite object, as it is composed of wood. The wood is also a composite object, as it is composed of molecules. Going down further, we eventually arrive at the fundamental particles (quarks, electrons, etc.), which are simple objects. However, each time we believe we have reached a simple object, we find that it is composed of smaller parts. For example, it was once thought that atoms were simple objects, but we now know they are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Then, we thought protons and neutrons were simple, but they are composed of a combination of up and down quarks, along with gluons that hold them together. What makes us think that quarks are simple objects, and not composed of even smaller parts? One response is that while we can always find smaller parts, there is a point at which we can no longer divide the object. This is not a matter of practicality, but a fundamental in-principle limitation. However, in order to be greater than a mere stipulation, this will need extensive justification. The third premise states that every object is caused or is the cause of another object. Written this way, that's just false - abstract objects, like numbers, are not caused. This premise is likely meant to apply only to concrete objects, but it should be stated explicitly. The fourth premise states that the sum of all caused simple objects is an object. This seems to carry a commitment to mereological universalism, the view that every collection of objects has a sum.

But the cause of its floating is the air that was blown into it. This is not disjoint, as the air inside the balloon is also part of the balloon. Hence, we have a cause that is not wholly disjoint from the object. The sixth premise states that every caused composite object contains a caused proper part. (Proper parts are parts that are not identical to the whole. Similar to proper subsets in set theory.) This also seems to not be completely true. Consider some uncaused simple objects. one of them causes the others to come together in a certain way and form a new object. This new object is a composite object, but it does not contain any caused proper parts; it is composed of uncaused simple objects.

Furthermore, it allows the proponent to easily dismiss the common objection, \"what caused God?\" by simply asserting that God did not begin to exist. For an object to begin to exist at time , that means that it exists after time but not before time - that is, the object has an earliest temporal boundary at time . But with that definition, where have you seen something begin to exist, at all? When, for example, a car is built, the car itself does not begin to exist. The car is just a rearrangement of pre-existing matter, where pre-existing means that it is ontologically and temporally prior. In fact, we can construct a mirror argument to the KCA: Everything that begins to exist is made of pre-existing (ontologically or temporally prior) stuff. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe is made of pre-existing stuff. (1, 2) This mirror argument would then challenge the creation of the universe ex nihilo, which then disproves traditional theism. Additionally, the mirror-premise has the same intuitive support as the original premise; it's intuitive, supported by inductive reasoning, supported by empirical evidence, and proved helpful in scientific inquiry.

The Big Bang Theory does not say that the universe began to exist; it says that the universe was in a hot, dense state around 13.8 billion years ago. More specifically, at that time, our local spatiotemporal manifold began expanding from an high-energy, high-density single point. However, the Big Bang Theory does not say anything about the universe's existence before that point. There could be other spatiotemporal manifolds that temporally precede our own. To support the lack of consensus, Graham Oppy has written the following: \"There is currently no widespread consensus among expert cosmologists about whether we live in something like a standard big bang universe or whether our universe is part of an infinite ensemble of universes in a background de Sitter space in which there is an infinite causal regress.\" Additionally, the idea of time itself is a subject of debate. Even if we grant past-finitude (that the universe has a finite past), that does not imply that the universe began to exist. Prior to the beginning of a metric time (like the one we experience), there could have been a pre-metric time; it could be amorphous (like a timeless state), or it could be undifferentiated (like a state where time is not a meaningful concept). The universe could also simply be timeless before metric time, and then temporal after metric time. A good intuition for this is to think of \"What is temporally prior to the Big Bang?\" as akin to \"What is north of the North Pole?\" - the latter is obviously a nonsensical question, and the former might be as well.","s":"Scientific Analysis","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Kalam CA","h":"#scientific-analysis","p":79},{"i":90,"t":"Many philosophical justifications for the second premise rely on the impossibility of an actual infinite; that is, a collection of things that has no beginning and no end. More formally, an actual infinite is a collection of things that can form a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) with the set of natural numbers . First, the argument from successive addition states that you can't form an actual infinite by adding one thing at a time. But for an infinite past, one is not beginning with a starting finite set and adding to it; one is beginning with an infinite set and adding more to it, resulting in, still, an infinite set. One response is that if you cannot count to infinity, then you cannot count down from infinity either. However, there is a difference between counting to infinity and counting down from infinity; the reason that it is impossible to count to infinity is that the set of natural numbers does not end; there is no predecessor to . However, the past does have an end - the present. Second, there is a common argument that actual infinites cannot exist based on Hilbert's Hotel. This argument states that if you have a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and all the rooms are full, you can still accommodate a new guest by moving the guest in room to room . Similarly, if you have an infinite number of guests, you can accommodate a new guest by moving the guest in room to room . This argument is meant to show that actual infinites lead to absurdities. However, this argument is not convincing. Here are some reasons why: These \"absurdities\" are a result from manipulating numbers (the room numbers), but obviously, you can't manipulate past events in the same way. Even if we grant that these absurdities are real, one could dismiss them as a result of mathematical realism - the belief that mathematical objects exist independently of human thought - because we can cacept that there are infinitely many mathematical objects. (This is opposed to nominalism, which states that mathematical objects are just useful fictions.) Taking a step further, let's grant the entire argument; that actual infinites lead to absurdities. But that also means that the future cannot be infinite. The future is an actual infinite - it is a collection of what will happen (not what would have happened at some point in the future.) - and so, the future cannot be infinite. Think of it as the answer to \"how many days from now on will occur?\". Each following day can be paired with a natural number, and hence form a bijection with , becoming an actual infinite. Additionally, according to eternalism, the future is just as real as the past - it already exists in the same way that the past does - further supporting the idea that the future is an actual infinite. This contradicts against traditional theism, which states that the future is infinite (the afterlife, eternal life, etc.). Third, there are some arguments for causal finitism, which states that there cannot be an infinite causal chain. A Benardete paradox goes as follows: suppose that there is an infinite chain of dominoes, each knocking down the next. If the chain is infinite, then there is no first domino to start the chain. But if there is no first domino, then the chain cannot start. This argument is meant to show that an infinite causal chain is impossible. However, this argument is not convincing either because Benardete paradoxes rely on a logically inconsistent logical structure (unfortunately, the paradox is too long to explain here), and even if granted, it could also be applied to the future. In conclusion, the second premise is not as well-supported as it seems, and there are many objections to it.","s":"Philosophical Analysis","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Kalam CA","h":"#philosophical-analysis","p":79},{"i":92,"t":"The conclusion of the KCA is that the universe has a cause. However, the KCA does not lead to a theistic conception of God. First, one could argue that because the cause is immaterial, and it has causal power, it must be a mind. There are other possible explanations for an immaterial cause with causal power, such as a timeless quantum field, a universal wavefunction that is not spatially or temporally bound, the Tau (a hypothetical particle that is the cause of the Big Bang), or other naturalistic explanations. Additionally, all minds that we know of are bound/embodied in spacetime, yet the cause is not bound in spacetime. This is a contradiction. Also, the assertion that the cause is immaterial is not well-supported because it could be material but timeless (non-metric time, amorphous time, etc.). Second, another argument is that since a timeless cause is creating a temporal effect, this must come from a personal or free agent. However, this is not necessarily true; the only criteria is that the cause is not sufficient to necessitate the effect, meaning that only indeterministic causation is required, and impersonal indeterministic causation is possible (quantum mechanics). Third, some argue that in order to create the universe, the cause must be very powerful. However, this is not necessarily true; the cause only needs to initiate a causal chain, not sustain it (existential inertia - the idea that temporal concrete objects continue to exist even under the absence of sustaining causes, so long as they are not destroyed by external causes). In order to begin metric time, it simply needs to cause change - that's it.

For example, the second premise, \"There is a possible explanation of the fact that there are contingent beings\", falls into a symmetry problem - we can make a premise \"There is no possible explanation of the fact that there are contingent beings\", and there is no reason that one would be logically favored over the other. The third premise, put simply, states that in order to explain the existence of contingent beings, one cannot invoke an explanation that only includes contingent beings. That's just not true - one could simply posit the following: \"There are necessarily some contingent beings.\" This would be a possible explanation of the existence of contingent beings, and it does not entail the existence of a necessary being. This then falsifies the fourth premise, and hence, the conclusion.","s":"Principle of Epistemic Explanations (PPE)","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/CA without PSR","h":"#principle-of-epistemic-explanations-ppe","p":93},{"i":100,"t":"Leibniz was a German philosopher and mathematician who lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Consider the first premise of the argument, and more specifically, what it means for a reason to \"explain\" the existence of something: As a removal of doubt - the reason removes doubt about why something exists. This is a more epistemic interpretation. As a relation - this could be causation, or a realization, or a grounding relation. For example, the structure of transistors grounds the structure of a circuit. An object cannot be its own reason for existence, because that would imply that it is both prior and posterior to itself. Even in an epistemic sense, it would not make any sense to say \" is true because is true\". This means that must be explained by , and must be explained by , and so on ad infinitum. One way to stop this infinite regress is to construct a causal loop, but this leads to circular reasoning, which is, to a certain extent, a type of self explanation. The next logical question is to ask why the infinite chain exists in the first place. This cannot be explained by any constituent elements in the chain, because the chain itself is the object of explanation. It would not make sense to say \"there are fish in the sea because there is a fish in the sea\". One could posit an explanation for the chain, but that would itself be then part of the chain. All this means is that if we accept the PSR, then it leads to an infinite regress. Hence, we have to restrict the PSR to only apply to certain types of things, like contingent things.

T: i.e. if it is necessary that , then . 5: i.e. if it is possible that , then it is necessary that it is possible that . Oppy's paper begins with the preliminary definitions for the argument: Def 1: A possible world is a maximal compossible conjunction of abstract propositions. Def 2: The Big Conjunctive Fact—BCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Def 3: The Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact—BCCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the contingent propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Some terminology: Compossible means that the propositions can all be true at the same time. More concretely, it means that they do not contradict each other. Maximal means that there are no other propositions that can be added to the conjunction without making it inconsistent. This means that for any proposition , either or is in the conjunction. Oppy makes a distinction between the weak and strong PSR, noting the primary difference being a proposition \"possibly having an explanation\" or just \"having an explanation\". Then, Oppy writes a paragraph to show that the first premise of the Gale-Pruss argument entails the strong PSR: Suppose that there is a world which is such that the BCF for that world has no explanation in that world. Let the BCF for that world be . Consider the conjunctive proposition: and has no explanation. By hypothesis, this conjunctive proposition is true in . Hence, by W-PSR, there is a world in which this conjunction is true and has an explanation. (Of course, by the rest of the Gale and Pruss proof, this world is none other than itself.) So the conjunctive proposition, that and has no explanation, has an explanation in . But that's absurd. If there is an explanation of why obtains and has no explanation, there there is an explanation of why obtains. Hence both has and lacks an explanation in . Contradiction! So there can be no world which is such that the BCF for lacks an explanation in . What this means is; imagine a proposition that has no explanation in a world . Then, consider the proposition \" is true and has no explanation\". By the weak PSR, this proposition must have an explanation in another world . But this means that has an explanation in .

It reports the \"state of affairs\" (the state of a system at a given time) being governed by the laws of nature. A personal explanation is one that explains a fact by appealing to the intentions of a person. For instance, to explain why a glass broke, a scientific explanation would involve the laws of physics, while a personal explanation would involve the intentions of a person who broke the glass. Gale and Pruss point out that scientific explanations are generalizations over contingent facts, hence scientific explanations are also contingent and included in the BCCP. Thus the explanation of the BCCP must be a personal explanation, which involves a necessary being. However, this fails to consider one small detail: there are other types of explanations, such as: Metaphysical explanations; one that cites neither intentions nor the evolution of some system or the state of the system at a given time, governed by the laws of nature. For instance, Pruss is an Aristotelian. Aristotelianism posits formal causality, the claim that there are \"forms\" that underlie the existence of things. This form is not a personal agent with intentions causing the various parts to combine, nor is this a scientific explanation. In science, one would not appeal to substantial forms, since it is a metaphysical explanation. Furthermore, it is not governed by \"deterministic or statistical\" laws of nature, and does not deal with some state of affairs. Other examples of metaphysical explanations include the concept of grounding; the structure of DNA is grounded in the laws of chemistry. However, this is not a scientific explanation according to their definition, since it does not involve the state of a system at some time being governed by the laws of nature. Functional realization is another example; things have functions and are realized by certain structures. Part of the reason why something exists is because its constituents realize a certain function. Ethical explanations; these are explanations that involve moral facts. For instance, to explain why violence is wrong, one might appeal to the fact that it causes suffering. This does not cite the intentions of a person or the laws of nature, and is hence not a scientific or personal explanation. Mathematical explanations; these are explanations that involve mathematical facts. For instance, to explain why , one might appeal to the axioms of arithmetic. Additionally, neither the argument nor the paper by Gale and Pruss provide sufficient explanation for the contingency of scientific explanations. Science could rely on necessary truths, such as some fundamental laws of nature, quantum fields, universal wavefunctions, and the like. In conclusion, this distinction is first, a false dichotomy, and second, does not hold up to scrutiny.","s":"Distinction between Types of Explanations","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Gale Pruss CA","h":"#distinction-between-types-of-explanations","p":109},{"i":126,"t":"One critique of the Leibniz cosmological argument comes from philosopher Stuart Davis.

One would not necessarily concieve this sum as a thing of its own right. In the most extreme case, mereological nihilism denies the existence of sums altogether. This is a radical position, but one would still have to defend this commitment to sums. The fifth axiom A5 is also problematic. The milky way and the andromeda galaxy both exist, but their \"whole\", the Milkdromeda galaxy (which is when they eventually collide), does not exist. This is a counterexample to A5. To take another example, you can have a collection of parts of a car, but that does not mean that the car itself exists. One would have to defend A5 by invoking a statement of spatio-temporal arrangement of parts as a part itself, but that's not immediately obvious - when one lists the parts of a car individually, and miss their arrangement, someone else would not call them out and tell them that they are missing a part (the arrangement).

If is contingent, then is part of the BCCF, which means is self-explanatory. This cannot be the case, so must be necessary. However, not all conjuctions like the BCCF make sense. Consider the conjuction of all non-self-conjunctive propositions, where a self-conjunctive proposition is one that is conjunctive of itself. is either self-conjunctive or not. If is self-conjunctive, since contains non-self-conjunctive propositions, it is not self-conjunctive. If is not self-conjunctive, since contains all non-self-conjunctive propositions, then contains itself, and is hence self-conjunctive. This presents a major contradiction, and so the BCCF is not necessarily a coherent concept. The BCCF is highly criticized. For instance, this paper by Christopher M. P. Tomaszewski, titled \"The Principle of Sufficient Reason Defended: There Is No Conjunction of All Contingently True Propositions\", completely rejects the idea of a BCCF. The paper refutes Peter van Inwagen's argument that the PSR entails \"modal collapse\", where absolutely everything is necessary. Tomazewski states that a critical flaw in van Inwagen's argument is the assumption that there is a conjuction of all contingently true propositions. He argues that there are too many propositions to conjunct through the use of Cantor's Theorem (directly quoted from the paper): There is a conjunction of all contingently true propositions . (Assumed) For each non-empty collection of propositions which are conjuncts of , there is a unique contingently true proposition to which it corresponds. Every such contingently true proposition is a conjunct of . (1) There are strictly more non-empty collections of propositions which are conjuncts of than there are propositions which are conjuncts of . (From Cantor's Theorem) There are strictly more propositions which are conjuncts of than there are propositions which are conjuncts of . (2, 3, 4) Therefore, there is no conjunction of all contingently true propositions. The paper also includes a defense of the second premise in the refutation of van Inwagen's argument. Start with a collection of conjuncts of , say , and let be the proposition that is the conjunction of all the conjuncts in . Let be an arbitrary necessary proposition. Then, consider the proposition : Each is a proposition that belongs to this collection. The inclusion of means that is not logically equivalent to any conjunction of the propositions in , and must hence be included in . What Tomaszewski is saying, essentially, is that for any conjuncts, you can find a unique proposition that is not in the conjuncts, hence defending the second premise. An elaboration of this argument is as follows: Assume there is a conjunction of all contingently true propositions. This is , and it can be written as . A conjunct is a proposition that is a part of the conjunction - , , etc. Now consider taking any collection of conjuncts, say , and forming a conjunction of them, . Since is a proposition, it must be a conjunct of . This means that all are conjuncts of . This is the key step. Cantor's Theorem states that for any set, the set of all of its subsets is strictly larger than the set itself. (Intuitively, think of it analogous to how there are 52 cards in a deck, but far more than 52 ways to choose an arbitrary number of cards from the deck.) This means that there are more collections of conjuncts than there are conjuncts. By Cantor's Theorem, there are more collections of conjuncts, like , than there are conjuncts, like , , etc. But by (3), all are part of .

It is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra is used in basically every field of mathematics, from number theory to geometry to topology to logic. Although we have already learned a lot of algebra in school, the algebra we learned is only a small part of the vast field of algebra. The algebra we learned in school is called elementary algebra, and it deals with the basic operations of arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Abstract algebra, on the other hand, is a more advanced form of algebra that deals with more abstract mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. These structures are used to study the properties of mathematical objects, such as numbers, vectors, and matrices, in a more general and systematic way.

You can think of displacement as the distance between the starting and ending points of an object's motion. For example, if you have a car that starts at position and ends at position , the displacement is . Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. It tells us how fast an object is moving and in what direction. Velocity is also a vector quantity, but in one dimension, it can be represented as a scalar.

Acceleration is also a vector quantity, but in one dimension, it can be represented as a scalar. Let's consider motion of a ball in one dimension. Throw a ball up in the air, and let it fall back down. The displacement of the ball at time is given by the function . This can be thought of the height of the ball above where it was thrown. We'll consider the motion of the ball from time to time . According to physics, objects fall under the influence of gravity, which causes them to accelerate downwards at a constant rate, usually denoted by . Therefore, we can write: Next, we can find the velocity of the ball at time by integrating the acceleration function: refers to the initial velocity of the ball, and can be denoted by or .

This includes topics such as limits, derivatives, and applications of derivatives. After studying differential calculus, students typically study integral calculus, which deals with the accumulation of quantities. This includes topics such as integrals, techniques of integration, and applications of integrals. Finally, students may study multivariable calculus, which extends the concepts of differential and integral calculus to functions of several variables. Calculus 1 and 2 are typically the first two courses in a calculus sequence, and cover the topics of differential and integral calculus, respectively. These courses are typically taken by students in their first or second year of college or university. AP Calculus AB and BC are somewhat equivalent to Calculus 1 and 2, respectively, though there's some differences in the content covered.

The notes in this section cover AP Calculus BC, but is written as Calculus 1 and 2, since there will eventually be a Calculus 3 section. There are many topics beyond Calculus 3.

Real Analysis is typically studied after Calculus 3, and goes back to the foundations of calculus, rigorously defining limits, derivatives, and integrals. This is important especially for students who plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics. Complex Analysis is typically studied after Real Analysis, and deals with the study of complex numbers and functions. This is important especially for students who, again, plan to study pure mathematics or theoretical physics.

Firstly, many people emphasize on the basis-free, theoretical approach to linear algebra. This approach focuses on the abstract properties of vector spaces, linear transformations, and other structures. Vector spaces are defined axiomatically, and theorems are proven about these abstract structures. In fact, vector spaces are a special case of a more general algebraic structure called a module, and many results in linear algebra can be generalized to modules over a ring. On the other hand, when we actually apply linear algebra to solve problems, we will need to work with matrices and vectors in a more concrete way. So some courses instead focus on the computational aspects of linear algebra, such as matrix operations, solving systems of linear equations, and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These courses are often more applied and less theoretical, and are more focused on applying linear algebra to solve other problems.","s":"How do We Teach Linear Algebra?","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra Advanced/Introduction","h":"#how-do-we-teach-linear-algebra","p":557},{"i":562,"t":"The simplest type of differential equation is a first order differential equation.

If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\" G. H. Hardy, 1940 The definition for mathematics is not as clear-cut as one might think. As the study of numbers - this is only partially true. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but also about shapes, patterns, and relationships. Many things deal with non-numerical concepts, such as geometry, topology, logic, and set theory. As a deductive science - this is also only partially true. Mathematical reasoning is not just deductive, but also inductive, sometimes even abductive. Many things deal with inductive reasoning, such as statistics, probability, and combinatorics. Rather than being \"pure\" or \"applied\", mathematics is a spectrum of both, and various fields of mathematics can lie anywhere on this spectrum. As the \"science of formal systems\" (Haskell Curry in 1951) - this does not capture the full essence of mathematics. Mathematics is not just about formal systems, but also about intuition, creativity, and discovery. Pure math without intuition is soulless. However, the definitions aside, there are some common themes in mathematics: Mathematics is about abstracting away the unnecessary details and focusing on the essential properties of objects. The first thing you learn, numbers, are abstractions of the real world. The number 1 is not a physical object; you can't say \"give me 1\". Instead, numbers, are abstractions of counting, and they have properties that are useful in various contexts. One advantage of abstraction is that it allows us to study a wide range of objects with similar properties. For instance, the same differential equations that describe the motion of a pendulum can also describe the flow of heat in a metal rod. Mathematics is logical. It is about making precise arguments and drawing conclusions from them. You start with a set of axioms, which are assumed to be true, and then use logical reasoning to derive theorems. The axioms are the starting point, and the theorems are the conclusions. The process of deriving theorems from axioms is called proof. However, mathematics is not just about proving theorems; estimation, approximation, and conjecture are also important. Mathematics is about patterns and structures. It is about recognizing patterns in the world and using them to build structures. For instance, the Fibonacci sequence is a pattern that appears in many natural phenomena, such as the branching of trees and the arrangement of leaves on a stem. The concept of a group is a structure that appears in many areas of mathematics, such as number theory, geometry, and algebra. Generally, mathematics is a logical, abstract, and creative discipline that studies the world in a precise and structured way.","s":"Introduction to Mathematics","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"","p":579},{"i":582,"t":"As previously mentioned, mathematics mixes together intuition and formulation. The intuition is the visual and intuitive interpretation of the concept, while the formulation is the more formal description that shows how the concept can be generalized and computed. The general discovery process for mathematics is; Specific Example → Intuition → Mathematical Model → Wide-Ranging Applications This shows the advantage of abstraction. By abstracting things into their fundamental properties, we can apply the same concepts to a wide range of problems. For instance, when Newton was studying the motion of the planets, he developed the concept of calculus to describe the motion of objects in general. Today, calculus is used everywhere, from physics to economics to computer science to just about every field you can think of. One shortcoming of the modern education system is that it usually does this process in reverse. It starts with the formulation. This is probably partly responsible for the large distaste for mathematics.

These are just a few of the many branches of mathematics. Each branch has its own set of concepts, techniques, and applications, yet they are all interconnected in some way. Another way to categorize mathematics is by its level of abstraction: Pure mathematics, which studies abstract concepts and structures for their own sake. Applied mathematics, which uses mathematical tools and techniques to solve real-world problems. Pure and applied mathematics are not mutually exclusive; they are two ends of a spectrum. Many areas of mathematics lie somewhere in between, using abstract concepts to solve practical problems. One particular saying I like is that \"pure mathematics explores the world of mathematics, while applied mathematics explores the world with mathematics\".

One clever way to make the cross product depend on the directions of and is to make it perpendicular to both vectors. Imagine and as two vectors that define a plane. Then, the cross product should be perpendicular to this plane; it should \"stick out\" of the plane: However, there are two directions perpendicular to a plane - one pointing \"up\" and one pointing \"down\". We need a way to choose one of these directions without ambiguity. One way to do this is to use the right-hand rule. This rule is a convention, and it is used to ensure that the cross product is well-defined: The direction of the cross product is given by the right-hand rule: if you curl the fingers of your right hand from to , your thumb points in the direction of . Note that this has an interesting consequence: the cross product is not commutative. If you swap the order of the vectors, the direction of the cross product changes. Instead, the cross product is anticommutative: Also, this means that the cross product is only defined in three dimensions. In lower dimensions, like 2D, there is no unique direction perpendicular to a plane, so the cross product is not defined. In higher dimensions, there are multiple directions perpendicular to a plane, so the cross product is not unique. 3D is the \"sweet spot\" where the cross product is well-defined.","s":"Direction","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Cross Product Introduction","h":"#direction","p":726},{"i":737,"t":"In this page, we introduced the cross product as a way to multiply vectors.

In Clifford algebra, we can represent scalars, vectors, and even higher-dimensional objects like planes and volumes using a single mathematical object called a multivector. This system is very powerful and has applications in physics, computer graphics, and robotics. The geometric product is a very deep topic, and we will not delve into it in this note. We will just discuss two important things about the geometric product: In Clifford algebra, cross products are replaced by the wedge product.

This force is a vector quantity; its magnitude is the strength of the force, and its direction is the direction in which the force is applied. For example, if you push a box to the right, the force you apply is a vector pointing to the right. When a force is applied to an object, it can move by a certain distance . The quantity, work, represents how much energy is transferred to the object by the force. Thinking intuitively, if you push a box with the same force over a longer distance, you are giving it more energy. Similarly, if you push a box with a stronger force over the same distance, you are also giving it more energy. Thus, we can define work, as the product of the magnitudes of the force and distance, right? The problem with this definition is that it does not account for the direction of the force. Imagine you are pushing a box in an upward-right direction against a wall. The force you apply is in the upward-right direction, but the box only moves up. In this case, only the force component in the direction of the motion (up) contributes to the work done. So, in reality, the work done is: But wait... that's just the dot product of the force and the distance vector: The work is an extremely important concept in Physics, and the dot product is the key to understanding it. It's relevant to understanding how energy is transferred in various systems, which in turn is crucial for understanding the behavior of physical systems.","s":"Physical Work","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Dot Product Applications","h":"#physical-work","p":740},{"i":747,"t":"We know that the dot product can act as a way to project one vector onto another.

When light hits a surface, the intensity of the light is determined by the angle between the light source and the surface. Imagine a scene with a ground, a ball, a lamp, and a camera. The lamp emits light rays in all directions, and some of these rays hit the ball or the ground. Some others hit the ground, bounce off, and hit the ball. For our purposes, treat the camera as simply a grid of pixels. The goal of rendering is simply to determine the color of each of those pixels. The above scene is a simplified version of a rendering setup, with only one pixel on the camera. Let's assume a pixel can only have one color, so the only data is the intensity of light. The way we begin to calculate the intensity of light on a pixel is by imagining the pixel shooting a beam towards the ball. We're essentially working backwards from the camera to the light source. The light hits a point on the ball, denoted by . Denote the vector going from the ball back to the pixel as . Denote the the intensity at the point as . The first contribution to the intensity at is the light emitted from the ball itself. While it does not emit light in this case, in other cases, it would glow with a certain intensity. This can be denoted as . Hence: For the other contributions, we keep working backwards. Starting at point , we consider all the light that hits it by shooting rays from the point in all directions. For example, consider the light that hits directly from the lamp. It comes from a direction . Now, we need to think about the contributions from the lamp to the intensity at : How reflective the ball is; this is denoted by the reflectance of the ball, , where just means the light comes from and reflects to . The intensity of light at the point on the ball where the light hits, . The third factor is the angle between the light source and the point on the ball where the light hits. This is the key part. If the light was closer to the normal of the surface, it would be more intense, and vice versa. Wait... that's just a dot product: So we add a factor of to the equation. Hence, the intensity at due to the light from the lamp is: That's just the light coming from one specific direction (the lamp). To get the total intensity at , we need to consider all the light coming from all directions. More specifically, all directions from which light can hit - a hemisphere around the point, denoted by . Since we are going towards a continuous case (all directions), instead of thinking about individual directions , it's better to think of as a small cone of directions. The intensity at due to the light from the lamp is then the sum of the intensities from all these cones: As we make the cones smaller and smaller, this sum becomes an integral: Finally, the total intensity at is the emitted light plus the light from all other sources (which is the integral above): What we have just derived is known as the rendering equation.","s":"Lighting in Graphics","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Dot Product Applications","h":"#lighting-in-graphics","p":740},{"i":751,"t":"Recall that the dot product of two vectors and can be thought of as a measure of their similarity.

If we perform operations on these vectors, such as addition and scalar multiplication, will the resulting vectors still lie on the line? In other words, will operating on these vectors cause them to \"leak out\" of the line? If the resulting vectors still line on the line, then we say that the line is a linear subspace of the vector space. To assess whether our line is a linear subspace, let's think about it from a visual context: If you add two vectors on the line, the resulting vector will still lie on the line. If you multiply a vector on the line by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie on the line, since the direction of the vector does not change. Therefore, we can say that this line is a linear subspace of the vector space. A consequence of something being a linear subspace is that it itself is also a vector space. In a sense, a linear subspace is a \"mini\" vector space within a larger vector space.","s":"Linear Subspaces","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Formalizing Vector Spaces","h":"#linear-subspaces","p":885},{"i":898,"t":"As we said, a linear subspace has the property that if you take any two vectors in the subspace and add them together, the resulting vector will still be in the subspace. Whenever we have an operation that keeps an object within its own set, we call that operation closed. In this case, the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are closed on the subspace. Think about scalar multiplication for a moment. If you multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie in the subspace. This scalar can be , which means that all subspaces must contain the zero vector. This leads us to the formal definition of a linear subspace: The set is a linear subspace of the vector space if it satisfies the following properties: Closure under Addition: For any vectors and in , the vector is also in . Closure under Scalar Multiplication: For any vector in and any scalar , the vector is also in .

Recall that the span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. Let's consider a set of vectors and consider their span. If the span of forms a linear subspace, then it must satisfy the properties of a linear subspace. We can go through the properties of a linear subspace and check if the span satisfies them: Closure under Addition: If we take any two vectors in the span and add them together, the resulting vector must still be in the span. This is true, since the span contains all possible linear combinations of the vectors. When we add two linear combinations, we simply get another linear combination. Closure under Scalar Multiplication: If we take any vector in the span and multiply it by a scalar, the resulting vector must still be in the span. This is also true, since the span contains all possible linear combinations. When we multiply a linear combination by a scalar, we get another linear combination. Contains the Zero Vector: The span of any set of vectors must contain the zero vector. This is because the zero vector is itself a linear combination of the vectors in the set. Therefore, we can say that: For any set of vectors , the span of forms a linear subspace. This means that we can define a linear subspace simply by specifying a set of vectors that span it. In order for it to not have any redundant vectors, we can choose a set of vectors that are linearly independent. This set of vectors has a special name - it is called a basis for the subspace. Then, we can define the subspace as the set of all possible linear combinations of the basis vectors. A set of vectors is a basis for a linear subspace if: The vectors in are linearly independent.

This means that they also have the properties of vector spaces, meaning that we can perform operations on them just like we can on vector spaces. When we define and formulate things in linear algebra, a lot of things are related to linear subspaces. For instance, when we solve a system of linear equations, we get a subspace as the solution set. This also includes topics we haven't covered yet, such as eigenspaces, the images of linear transformations, and a lot of other things, all of which are linear subspaces.","s":"Why Bother with Linear Subspaces?","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Formalizing Vector Spaces","h":"#why-bother-with-linear-subspaces","p":885},{"i":904,"t":"In this section, we took what we know about vectors and formalized it into the concept of a vector space.

More formally speaking, a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies a set of properties, known as the axioms of a vector space. A linear subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space. Linear subspaces allow you to perform operations on a subset of vectors without them \"leaking out\" of the subset. Linear subspaces can be defined by specifying a set of vectors that span them, known as a basis. In the next section, we will temporary leave the world of vectors and dive into the world of matrices. This will allow us to understand a very fundamental concept in linear algebra - linear transformations. With a solid grasp of linear transformations, we will then return to vectors and explore more topics, such as dot products, cross products, and more.

In a linear subspace, the algebraic properties of addition and scalar multiplication are inherited from the parent vector space. Thus, we only need to check the axioms that are less obvious. Additive Identity: All linear subspaces, by definition, contain the zero vector. ✅ Additive Inverse: For any vector in the subspace, (since subspaces are closed under scalar multiplication) is also in the subspace. ✅ Next, consider whether the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are defined on the subspace. Since subspaces are closed under these operations, any time you add two vectors or multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector will still be in the subspace. Thus, these operations are perfectly valid and defined on the subspace.

However, we can start by positing these three interpretations of vectors: To a physicist, a vector is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. It can represent something's position, velocity, or some force acting on it. This is the most intuitive interpretation of a vector. These vectors are often represented as arrows in space, where the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector: To a programmer, a vector is just a list of numbers. It could be used to represent a point in space, but it could also represent other things. For example, very commonly, we can represent a color as a vector. All colors can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, so a color can be represented as a vector with three components. We hence call this vector three-dimensional. Vectors can also be used to represent other things that do not have to do with space. You could have a three-dimensional vector representing a person's age, height, and weight for example. These also apply in scientific studies. For instance, given a chemical reaction, we can represent each reactant and product as a separate component in a vector. In a reaction with 3 reactants and 2 products, we can represent the reaction as a 5-dimensional vector. Another example is in mathematics itself, where we can represent a polynomial as a list of its coefficients. To a mathematician, a vector is a member of a vector space. This is a more abstract definition, but it is the most general. A vector can be anything that has the notion of addition and multiplication defined on it. We will go into detail about this later. Vectors, as variables, can be notated in a few ways as well: As a bold lowercase letter, like . This is the most common way to notate vectors in digital text. As a lowercase letter with an arrow on top, like . This is the most common way to notate vectors in handwritten text, and older digital publications. Both of the above, like . This is a compromise between the two, and is most commonly used in educational materials. We will use this notation.","s":"What Even is a Vector?","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors/Thinking about Vectors","h":"#what-even-is-a-vector","p":908},{"i":915,"t":"Let's start by taking the perspective of a physicist. We have a vector which can represent anything. We can begin by drawing a coordinate system, and placing the vector in it: The point where it starts is called the tail of the vector, and the point where it ends is called the tip of the vector. However, note that the starting point of the vector is arbitrary. It can be more helpful to think of the vector as an \"instruction\" to move from the tail to the tip. If you imagine the -axis as east and the -axis as north, then the vector is an instruction to move 2 units east and 1 unit north. It will have the same meaning no matter where you place it in the coordinate system. To represent this vector as a list of numbers, we can look at the coordinates of the tip of the vector. In this case, the tip is at . Hence, we can represent the vector as: We use square brackets and separate the components vertically to distinguish vectors from regular points in space. Sometimes, especially in physics, vectors are written horizontally with commas separating the components, and angled brackets around them: As previously stated, this vector can be thought of as an instruction to move 2 units right and 1 unit up.

This means that in real analysis, we are primarily concerned with functions defined on the real number line. This also means that there are other types of analysis, such as complex analysis, which deal with functions defined on the complex plane.

Philosophers like John Locke (1632 - 1704) and Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796) pushed the concept of empiricism which posits that knowledge comes from one's experience. This was in contrast to rationalism, which posited that knowledge comes from reason. In the 19th century, physiological studies began investigating the human sensory systems. German philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 - 1894) measured the speed of nerve impulses and the speed of sound, and eventually, he came to the conclusion that senses are not infallible. This means that the senses can be fooled; that is, there is a psychological reality that is separate from the physical reality. While this was not a new idea, it was a new way of thinking about the senses. Helmholtz's work suggests that despite the fallibility of the senses, we can still use science to measure and understand the mind. This relationship between physical and psychological reality was studied by German researchers like Gustav Fechner (1801 - 1887) and Ernst Weber (1795 - 1878) in what's known as psychophysics. German physician Wilhelm Wundt (1832 - 1920) is often credited with establishing the first psychology laboratory in 1879. He: First strongly promoted the idea of psychology as an experimental science. Provided classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for students to study psychology. (1875) joined the University of Leipzig as a professor, making plans to establish a course in experimental psychology. (1879) established the first laboratory experience - usually considered the birth of psychology as a science. Wundt's work received great responses with students from all over the world coming to study under him. They were trained on various psychological experiments like: Introspection - the process of looking inward to examine one's own thoughts and feelings. Consciousness - the awareness of internal and external stimuli. Mental Chronometry - the study of reaction time. This demonstrates that the mind can be studied scientifically, and that consciousness could be revealed through science.","s":"Prehistory","u":"/notes/psychology/Introduction to Psychology/History of Modern Psychology","h":"#prehistory","p":1011},{"i":1016,"t":"Wundt's work was brought to the United States by one of his students, Edward Bradford Titchener (1867 - 1927).

He focused on the adult human mind, but excluded children, animals, and people with mental illnesses from his studies. This \"flavor\" of experimental psychology was popular in the United States, and it was taught in many universities. The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892, but Titchener thought it did not represent experimental psychology well. This led him to found the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1904. This society did not welcome women. However, Titchener's student Margaret Floy Washburn (1871 - 1939) is quite interesting: She was the first doctoral student of Titchener.

James states that consciousness is continuous and always changing, and that it cannot be broken down into smaller components. James wrote the most famous psychology textbook of the time, The Principles of Psychology (1890), and also became a professor at Harvard University.

That is, the reader should know that QM describes things at the smallest scale and that measurements are probabilistic. That's it. The first part of these notes will cover the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, including the state vector formalism, operators, and measurements. The \"physics\" begins when we first discuss the Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment, a simple experiment that demonstrates the inadequacy of classical physics in explaining the behavior of particles. We will also take a look at how the SG experiment parallels light polarization, from which we introduce the mathematical object called a spinor. These objects will be very important later on when we discuss quantum field theory. Light polarization can be modeled with SU(2) matrices, which are a subset of the unitary matrices that we will encounter in quantum mechanics. The reader might choose to first read about the SG experiment and then come back to the mathematical formalism. This could provide a motivation for the mathematical formalism, as the SG experiment demonstrates the inadequacy of classical physics in explaining the behavior of particles. The mathematical formalism is primarily based on the three postulates of quantum mechanics: The state of a quantum system is described by a state vector in a Hilbert space . The state vector contains all the information about the system, and the space is known as the state space. For a composite system, the state space is the tensor product of the state spaces of the individual systems. An observable is represented by a Hermitian operator acting on the state space. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible outcomes of a measurement of the observable, and the eigenvectors correspond to the states of the system after the measurement. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is given by the Born rule, which states that the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state vector with the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. The time evolution of a quantum system is described by the Schrödinger equation, which is a linear partial differential equation that describes how the state vector changes with time. The Schrödinger equation is given by: where is the reduced Planck constant, is the Hamiltonian operator, and is the state vector at time . It's important to consider what a postulate is - it is a statement that is assumed to be true without proof. This might make it seem like a theory like QM is built on some arbitrary assumptions that come from nowhere, and many courses and textbooks do make it seem that way. However, the postulates of QM are not arbitrary - they are based on experimental evidence and are the simplest set of assumptions that can explain the phenomena we observe. In other words, the postulates are the result of the scientific method, not the starting point. An analogy is the axioms of Euclidean geometry. For example, \"two points determine a line\" is an axiom of Euclidean geometry. This is not something that Euclid just made up - it is a statement that is based on observation and is the simplest assumption that can explain the properties of lines in geometry. In the same way, the postulates of QM are based on experimental evidence and are the simplest assumptions that can explain the behavior of particles on the quantum scale. We will try to motivate these postulates as we go along, but it's important to remember that they are not arbitrary.","s":"Overview","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/intro","h":"#overview","p":1033},{"i":1038,"t":"The main resources used for these notes are: Youtube Series: \"Maths of Quantum Mechanics\" by Brandon Sandoval.

It is much more comprehensive than the YouTube playlist (since the YT playlist just covers the maths), and it goes into more depth on the physics. This textbook is about early-graduate level, so we will eventually go beyond the scope of this book.

Instead, particles are merely excitations of these fields. Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines quantum mechanics and special relativity to study these fields and their interactions. Our current understanding of the universe is based on the Standard Model of particle physics, which is a quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces. It is defined by the Standard Model Lagrangian: As one can see, there are a bunch of probably unfamiliar symbols in the equation above. Being very abstract and mathematical, QFT is often considered one of the most challenging subjects in theoretical physics, and it is usually taught at the graduate level. (The other challenging subject being General Relativity. Personally I find QFT more challenging.) However, QFT is incredibly successful in describing the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions. This set of notes aims to introduce the basics of quantum field theory from the ground up. The goal is to start from high-school level physics and mathematics and build up all the way to the full theory of quantum field theory, with all of its complexities and subtleties. The main topics covered will be: Quantum mechanics arose in the early 20th century as a response to the failure of classical mechanics to explain the behavior of certain things. It is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest scales. Classical field theory is a generalization of classical mechanics that describes fields, which are functions of space and time. It is generally described by the Lagrangian density, which is a function of the fields and their derivatives. Special relativity is a theory that describes the relationship between space and time. Starting from the postulates of special relativity, we can derive the Lorentz transformations, which describe how coordinates change under a change of reference frame. I will assume that the reader is familiar with special relativity. These are then combined into relativistic field theory, relativistic quantum mechanics, and nonrelativistic quantum field theory, which are then finally combined into quantum field theory. This will be a very long set of notes, starting from the foundations of all these theories and building up to the full theory of quantum field theory.","s":"Quantum Field Theory from the Ground Up","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/intro","h":"","p":1039},{"i":1042,"t":"In the previous section, we discussed the Lagrangian formalism and how it can be used to describe the dynamics of a system of particles.

For example, the Sun-Earth system can be described by the positions and momenta of the Sun and the Earth. Then, we introduce forces that act on these particles, such as the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth: Likewise, for two charges and , the electrostatic force between them is given by Coulomb's law: In this description, the forces act instantaneously across space. Any interaction between two objects only requires that the objects are there, and that there is empty space between them. This is known as action-at-a-distance. However, this is not how the universe works. There is a fundamental principle in physics known as locality, which states that interactions between objects can only occur at the same point in space and time. This prevents instantaneous transmission of information across space, as it would violate the principles of special relativity. To see why action-at-a-distance is problematic, consider two events and that are spacelike separated (i.e., light cannot travel between them). If event affects event , then there must be a causal relationship between them. If causes , then we would hope that always precedes in all reference frames. However, if the events are spacelike separated, there are reference frames in which precedes . This leads to a contradiction, as causality would be violated. As a step towards resolving this issue, we introduce the concept of field theory. Instead of describing the dynamics of individual particles, we describe the dynamics of fields, which are functions of space and time. For example, in the gravitational case, instead of describing the force between two particles, we describe the gravitational field at every point in space and time: The field tells us how a test mass would move at the point at time . Similarly, in the electromagnetic case, we describe the electric and magnetic fields and at every point in space and time. These field vectors are functions of space and time and describe the forces that act on charged particles. They can be further generalized as potentials, which are scalar and vector fields that describe the forces acting on particles. For instance, the electric and magnetic fields and can be derived from the electric potential and the magnetic vector potential : As a consequence of locality, fields can evolve even in the absence of particles - think of electromagnetic waves propagating through empty space.

In \"regular\" classical mechanics, we have particles moving around in space, characterized by their positions and momentums.

In the Sun-Earth system, the gravitational force acts on both the Sun and the Earth. It is equal to , i.e. inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects. Suppose that the Sun mysteriously disappears at some point in time . Using what we know so far, we would say that at exactly , the force would vanish, and the Earth will start moving in a straight line (because there are no external forces left). However, the Sun and Earth have a distance of , and light takes minutes to travel that distance. From special relativity, we know that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, or else there would be reference frames in which the information is received before it is sent. But in this case, the Earth would start moving in a straight line before the information that the Sun disappeared reaches it. Hence, there is an inherent contradiction, and something is wrong with our current description of the system. What I just described is known as action-at-a-distance, where the force acts instantaneously across space. Any interaction between two objects only requires that objects are there, and that there is empty space between them. Mutual forces are instantaneously transmitted across space, regardless of the distance between the objects. This is not how the universe works. In order to fix this, we introduce the concept of field theory.

Noether's theorem is very important later on in quantum field theory, where symmetries play a central role in the formulation of the theory. Finally, we will extend our understanding of Lagrangians to more complex systems, such as relativistic systems, general relativity, and eventually, string theory. In general relativity, the Lagrangian is the Einstein-Hilbert action and describes the dynamics of spacetime. Most notably, spacetime is curved by the presence of mass and energy, and this makes it very interesting to study. We will put our knowledge of Lagrangians to the test by deriving the Einstein field equations from the Einstein-Hilbert action. In string theory, the Lagrangian describes the dynamics of strings, which are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. At a basic level, imagine that instead of an object tracing a worldline in spacetime, it is a string (think of a rubber band) that traces a world-area, or a \"worldsheet\".

For example, a person standing still on the ground is in an inertial frame of reference, while a person in a car that is accelerating is not. In inertial frames of reference, the laws of physics are the same.

Galilean Relativity","u":"/notes/relativity","h":"#1-galilean-relativity","p":1075},{"i":1080,"t":"Special relativity is a more advanced form of relativity that was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century. There are a few reasons that Galilean relativity is not sufficient to describe the universe, but the most fundamental one is the speed of light. Essentially, from Maxwell's equations, we can derive the wave equation for light, which gives us the following: (To derive this, assume we are in a vacuum where and . Then, start with Faraday's law, take the curl of both sides, use the identity . Then apply the Ampère-Maxwell law and cancel out the term with since it is zero.) Following this, we can derive that the speed of light is in a vacuum. But and are fundamental constants of nature, so is also a fundamental constant of nature. (Additionally, unlike other waves, light does not require a medium to propagate through, so it doesn't have anything to measure its speed against.) This contradicts Galilean relativity, which, if you remember, allows frames of reference to disagree on speeds. Another reason is that electromagnetism is not invariant under Galilean transformations. Specifically, the Lorentz force law is not invariant under Galilean transformations. Einstein's solution was to \"add\" the speed of light to the list of physical laws. In other words, the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. This leads to the following postulates of special relativity: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. (Same as Galilean relativity) The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference. (New) Because we have to agree on the speed of light, we have to \"sacrifice\" some other things: Galilean Relativity Special Relativity Frames disagree on position Still disagree on position Frames agree on time No longer agree on time - , , etc. No longer valid - the time variable is different, so we cannot differentiate in the same way Velocities add simply No, since there is a \"speed limit\" Laws of motion work in all inertial frames Needs rethinking The consequences of special relativity are often extremely counterintuitive because it challenges our fundamental notions of space and time. These include time dilation (moving clocks run slower), length contraction (moving objects are shorter), and the relativity of simultaneity (events that are simultaneous in one frame are not in another). However, these consequences only become significant at speeds close to the speed of light; at everyday speeds, the effects are completely negligible. It must be noted that the reasons for the origin of special relativity are definitely not, by any means, obvious. It challenges Galilean relativity, which not only has been around for centuries but also seems to rely on nothing but common sense. Because of the counterintuitive nature of special relativity, Einstein's theory was not immediately accepted by the scientific community. In fact, his Nobel Prize was not for special relativity, but for his work on the photoelectric effect. What I've described so far is most of what students learn in a first course on special relativity. However, things run much deeper than that, and there are many more interesting consequences and implications of special relativity. Firstly, we will make the observation that a noninertial reference frame can be treated as a series of inertial reference frames. Essentially, if we divide the noninertial frame into small pieces, each piece can be treated as an inertial frame, and as we take the limit as the pieces become infinitesimally small, we can treat the entire noninertial frame as an inertial frame. An accelerating object, in the reference frame of a stationary observer, traces out a hyperbolic path in spacetime. Accelerating objects have a few interesting properties. For example, an accelerating object will see a \"Rindler horizon\" - a boundary beyond which it cannot see. This is because light from beyond the horizon cannot reach the accelerating object. It's also very similar to the event horizon of a black hole, hence the shared title of \"horizon\". We will need a curvilinear coordinate system that is appropriate for describing the motion of an accelerating object - the Rindler coordinates. These coordinates are notably more difficult to work with than the previous transformations we've seen, but they are necessary for describing the motion of an accelerating object. We will \"upgrade\" our current mathematical toolkit to be able to handle these more complex transformations: The basis vectors can be written as a tangent vector - . This allows them to change as we move along the curve. The transformations can no longer be described by a simple matrix - we need to use the Jacobian, which, in short, is a linear map that is different at each point. The notions of straight lines and circles are no longer valid - we need to use geodesics, which are the straightest possible lines in curved space. To do this, we will introduce some concepts from differential geometry, including the covariant derivative. While it may seem like we are going off on a tangent, these concepts give us a headstart into the next topic - general relativity.","s":"2. Special Relativity","u":"/notes/relativity","h":"#2-special-relativity","p":1075},{"i":1082,"t":"General relativity is a form of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, that extends special relativity to include gravity. The fundamental idea behind general relativity comes from the equivalence principle, which states (roughly speaking) that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration. This is a very powerful idea because it means that gravity is \"special\", unlike other forces like electromagnetism or the strong force. It comes from the observation that the gravitational force is and . By many experiments, we know that - the inertial mass is equal to the gravitational mass. Substituting one into the other, we get - the acceleration due to gravity is the same as the acceleration due to a force. This means that the acceleration is the same regardless of mass, shape, or composition of the object, which is different from every other force. Over large distances, the equivalence principle no longer holds, because the forces will be different at different points. This leads to the existence of tidal forces, which are the differences in gravitational forces at different points in space. For example, the Moon exerts a stronger gravitational force on the side of the Earth facing it than on the side facing away from it, leading to the tides. In special relativity, there is no reference frame that you can be in where you can \"replicate\" tidal forces - tidal forces cannot be explained with flat spacetime. Thus, we need a new theory of gravity that can explain tidal forces. General relativity treats spacetime as a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold. While these words sound complicated, they are actually quite simple in principle. Essentially, instead of treating gravity as a force, general relativity treats gravity as a curvature in spacetime. If spacetime is a sheet of paper, then gravity is like placing a heavy ball in the middle of the paper - it curves the paper around it. The mathematics of general relativity is quite complex, and involves a lot of differential geometry. A manifold is a curved space that is locally flat, meaning that if you zoom in close enough, it looks like a flat space. A simple example is the surface of the Earth, which is curved but looks flat when you're standing on it. We will first explore manifolds in more detail, starting from the distinction between the intrinsic and extrinsic views of a manifold. The intrinsic view is the view from being \"on top of\" the manifold (or a bug's eye view), while the extrinsic view is the view from \"outside\" the manifold (or a bird's eye view). To build on this, we will introduce the tangent space, which is a vector space that is \"attached\" to each point on the manifold. Using the concept of manifolds, we will extend concepts like arc lengths, gradients, geodesics, and the covariant derivative to curved spaces. There are three mathematical objects that describe the curvature of a manifold: the Riemann curvature tensor , the Ricci tensor , and the Ricci scalar . The Riemann curvature tensor describes the curvature of spacetime at each point. It can be interpreted with a concept called holonomy - if a vector is parallel transported around a closed loop, it will change direction if the space is curved. The Ricci tensor is a contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor, and describes the \"average\" curvature at each point. The Ricci scalar is then a contraction of the Ricci tensor, and describes the overall curvature of spacetime. We will introduce the Newton-Cartan theory as a stepping stone, which is a simpler version of general relativity that is easier to work with. By starting with Newton's law of gravity, we can derive Poisson's equation . When one writes the Laplacian out in an orthonormal basis, one can see that this equation closely resembles a geodesic equation. Specifically, if we let the parameter of the geodesic be time (which is invariant here because we are in a nonrelativistic setting) and adjust the connection coefficients properly, it is a geodesic equation. Because the connection coefficients are defined, we can then derive the Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the Ricci scalar. Finally, by seeing that is equal to the Laplacian of the gravitational potential, then . This theory is good and also explains tidal forces, but it is not compatible with special relativity. Specifically, is not invariant under Lorentz transformations. It is a measure of mass over volume, but as we know, length contraction can change the volume. This will lead to the thought that perhaps is part of a larger object, one that is invariant under Lorentz transformations, just like . It turns out that this object is the energy-momentum tensor , which is a mathematical object that describes the distribution of energy and momentum in spacetime. It is related to the concept of flux. Finally, after all this time, we have every piece of the puzzle to assemble Einstein's field equations. Making the adjustment from the Newton-Cartan theory, we can replace and with their tensor counterparts: . There is a problem, however - the right hand side, due to conservation of energy and momentum, must have zero divergence. But by the Bianchi identity, the left hand side does not have zero divergence. Instead, by adding a term to the left hand side, we can satisfy the conservation of energy and momentum. Additionally, by metric compatibility, we can add a constant to the left hand side without affecting the divergence. (This is known as the cosmological constant, and it is a constant that is added to the left hand side of the field equations to account for the expansion of the universe.) Finally, we can calculate the proportionality constant to be by approximating the equation in the weak field limit and comparing it to Newton's law of gravity. Then, we have the final form of Einstein's field equations: An alternative approach to derive the field equations is to start with the action principle. To recap, the action is something that is minimized (or more precisely, stationary) along the path that the system takes. It is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian over time. In general relativity, the action is called the Einstein-Hilbert action, and it is defined as the integral of the Ricci scalar over spacetime. By varying the action with respect to the metric tensor, we can derive the field equations. These equations are the cornerstone of general relativity, and describe how spacetime is curved by the presence of mass and energy. Because this is a tensor equation, there are 16 equations in total (4 for each and ), but they are not all independent. Specifically, the metric tensor is symmetric, so there are only 10 independent equations. The rest of the course will be spent exploring the consequences and implications of general relativity.","s":"3.

It was Karl Schwarzschild who first found an exact solution to the field equations, which described the spacetime around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. This solution is now known as the Schwarzschild metric: where is a quantity known as the Schwarzschild radius. Notice that when , interesting things happen. The component of the metric becomes zero, while the component becomes infinite. This is known as a coordinate singularity (not to be confused with a physical singularity), and it is a point where the coordinates of the metric become ill-defined. Furthermore, the coordinates change such that the radial coordinate becomes time-like and the time coordinate becomes space-like, creating a fundamental shift in the nature of spacetime. This is known as the event horizon, and it is the boundary beyond which light cannot escape. The Schwarzschild metric does not only describe the spacetime around a black hole, but also the spacetime around any spherically symmetric mass. It can be used to derive other interesting phenomena, such as gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. The perihelion precession of Mercury is a particularly interesting phenomenon, as it was one of the first experimental confirmations of general relativity. Another interesting thing about black holes is that they have a temperature and an entropy. General relativity alone predicts that black holes will always absorb matter and energy, and never emit anything, eventually growing to infinite size. This is one of the few places where general relativity and quantum mechanics clash. According to quantum mechanics, at the event horizon of a black hole, virtual particles can be created on either side. If one of these particles falls into the black hole, the other can escape to become a real particle. This incurs a loss of mass for the black hole. By the equivalence of mass and energy, this means that the black hole emits radiation. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation.","s":"Black Holes and the Schwarzschild Metric","u":"/notes/relativity","h":"#black-holes-and-the-schwarzschild-metric","p":1075},{"i":1087,"t":"The wave equation applies when the Laplacian of a function is proportional to the second derivative of the function with respect to time.

Evolution broadly refers to the gradual change in heritable characteristics within a population over time. Natural selection, on the other hand, is a key mechanism driving evolution. It describes the differential survival and reproductive success of individuals possessing traits that make them better suited to their environment. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that evolution is not synonymous with progress. It is not a linear process culminating in the production of more complex or \"advanced\" organisms. Rather, it is a dynamic, non-directional process, with no inherent goal or endpoint. The evolutionary process is contingent upon the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and reproductive success. An important concept in evolution is that of a species. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Humans are, for instance, homo sapiens. Over time, species can change. This is called speciation.

This theory works well for objects that are not too small or moving too fast, hence \"everyday\" scales. Problems in classical mechanics are solved primarily by Newton's laws (or by the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, which are more general and can be applied to more complex systems). By the 20th century, classical mechanics was well understood and was considered a \"complete\" theory. However, it was soon discovered that classical mechanics was not sufficient to explain a variety of phenomena, which is why new theories were developed. At very small scales, we have quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum mechanics is based on waves and probabilities, and it is used to describe the behavior of particles like electrons and photons. Quantum mechanics is a very successful theory and has been tested extensively in experiments. At very high speeds, we have special relativity, which describes the behavior of objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. From noticing that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames (because its value is based on two fundamental constants), Einstein made a series of postulates that led to the development of special relativity. Special relativity has many interesting consequences, such as time dilation and length contraction. At very large scales, we have general relativity, which describes the behavior of objects with very strong gravitational fields. Originally, due to a discrepancy between the predictions of Newtonian gravity and the observed orbit of Mercury, Einstein developed general relativity. It describes gravity not as a Newtonian force, but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. General relativity has been tested in many ways and has passed all tests so far. In fact, even the acceleration of the universe's expansion, which Einstein initially thought was a mistake in his equations, was later confirmed by observations. Electricity and Magnetism are part of classical physics. Outside of gravity, they are the forces that keep our lives on Earth running. All matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The interactions between these charges are what give rise to electricity and magnetism. This means that all of chemistry, biology, and even the functioning of our brains are based on the principles of electricity and magnetism. In fact, even the light that we see is an electromagnetic wave - the result of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. There are four equations that describe all of classical electromagnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. They are based on the work of many scientists, including Gauss, Ampère, and Faraday, but were first written down in their modern form by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century. Maxwell's equations are: Here, is the electric field, and is the magnetic field. A large part of classical electromagnetism is understanding how these fields interact with each other and with charges and currents. Eventually, we will see that these fields can be combined into a single field, known as the electromagnetic field, which is described by a single tensor. This field is what gives rise to electromagnetic waves, which are the basis of what we call light.","s":"Electricity and Magnetism","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electricity and Magnetism","h":"","p":1112},{"i":1115,"t":"We will try to cover the following topics: Electrostatics: We will start with a study of electric fields and potentials in static situations - when charges are not moving. This is largely comprised of first starting with Coulomb's law, showing that calculations with it are cumbersome, and then creating a framework to greatly simplify the calculations. This involves the concept of the electric field, as well as Gauss's law, which is the first of Maxwell's equations. Magnetostatics: We will then move on to magnetic fields and potentials in static situations. This is similar to electrostatics, but with a few key differences, since the magnetic force acts a bit differently from the electric force. Electrodynamics: We will then combine electric and magnetic fields to study how they interact with each other and with moving charges. This is where we derive the third and fourth Maxwell's equations. Electromagnetic waves: Finally, we will study how electric and magnetic fields can propagate through space as waves. This is where we will see how light is just an electromagnetic wave, and how it can be described by the same equations as any other electromagnetic wave. Special relativity: With the knowledge of electromagnetism, we will find out that Maxwell's equations are not invariant under Galilean transformations, which led Einstein to develop special relativity. We will see how special relativity is a natural consequence of the laws of electromagnetism. This roadmap is quite ambitious, and we may not be able to cover all of these topics in detail.

By the end, we will have a complete understanding of how these quantities are related and how they can be used to solve problems. We will begin with a discussion of how charge works, as well as the basic principles of electrostatics (and its position in modern physics). We will then move on to Coulomb's law, which describes the force between two charges. Using this law, along with the superposition principle, we can calculate the force between any number of charges. By now, electrostatics is, in principle, complete. Every problem can be solved using Coulomb's law and the superposition principle. However, this is not always the most efficient way to solve problems. Hence, we will introduce the concept of the electric field, and along with it, Gauss's law. Gauss's law is a powerful tool that allows us to calculate electric fields in situations with high symmetry.

The electric flux through a surface is defined as the electric field passing through the surface, weighted by the area of the surface. It can be thought of using a fluid analogy; the field lines are like a fluid, and the flux is the amount of fluid passing through the surface per unit area.

Each patch on the sphere corresponds to a patch on the new surface. This new patch on the surface will have a different distance and area. Now, notice that as the distance from the patch to the charge increases, (1) the electric field decreases by and (2) the area increases by . This means that they cancel out, and the flux through the new surface will be the same as the flux through the sphere. As such, for any surface enclosing a charge, the electric flux through the surface is . This is known as Gauss's Law: Gauss's Law, Integral Form: For any closed surface enclosing a charge , the electric flux through the surface is given by: For charges outside the surface, the flux through the surface is zero. The reason for this is that while the field lines pass through the surface, eventually the same amount of field lines will also exit the surface. Hence, the flux from each time a field line enters the surface is canceled out by the flux from each time a field line exits the surface.

So, taking the limit as the surface shrinks to zero, i.e. , we get: The left-hand side is known as the divergence of the electric field, denoted . On the right, we have the charge density . Then, this becomes the differential form of Gauss's Law: Gauss's Law, Differential Form: For any volume enclosing a charge density , the divergence of the electric field is given by: What we've done here is known as the Divergence Theorem, which, more generally, states: (The Divergence Theorem should make a lot of intuitive sense. The divergence of a vector field is essentially the flux per unit volume. Wouldn't it make sense that the total flux through a surface is equal to the flux per unit volume integrated over the volume?

All matter possesses charge, and it is responsible for the electromagnetic interactions between particles. Classical physics assumes that charge is continuous; that is, it can take on any value. Of course, we know that all charge in the universe is quantized in units of the elementary charge . However, the principles of classical physics still hold to an enormous degree of accuracy. The elementary charge is so small () that in most macroscopic situations, charge appears continuous. The second assumption is that charge distribution is continuous. This means that charge is spread out over a volume, and we can talk about the charge \"density\" at any point in space. Once again, we know that at a microscopic level, charge distribution is not continuous, rather there are particles with discrete charges that make up matter. This is not to say that classical electromagnetism does not study the interactions between individual charges. In fact, the entire field of electrostatics is built on the interactions between individual charges. We will see how Coulomb's Law, the most fundamental law of electrostatics, describes the force between two individual point charges. This is also not to say that classical electromagnetism is not useful; it is actually increasingly important in modern physics. Why? The Theory of Relativity does not change the laws of electromagnetism. In fact, the Theory of Relativity was developed to make electromagnetism consistent with the laws of physics. Quantum Mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, only deviates from classical physics in extreme situations. These situations are so small - ( times smaller than an atom) - that they are not relevant to most macroscopic situations. In fact, we can discuss the behavior of atoms and molecules using classical electromagnetism with great accuracy. In the case that quantum effects are important, a field called quantum electrodynamics is used, which is a quantum mechanical theory of electromagnetism.","s":"Classical View of Charge","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Thinking about Charge","h":"#classical-view-of-charge","p":1161},{"i":1168,"t":"It was experimentally discovered that there are two types of charge, where same charges repel and opposite charges attract. To make it mathematically convenient, we call one type of charge positive and the other negative. As current models suggest, any particle with a charge also has an antiparticle with the exact same properties, just with an opposite charge. This means that there are also antiprotons and positrons, which have negative and positive charges, respectively. Particles and their antiparticles can annihilate each other, releasing energy in the form of photons. This energy is what we see in particle accelerators, where particles are smashed together at high speeds to create new particles and study their properties. In the early universe, when the temperature was high enough, particles and antiparticles were created in equal amounts. Due to some unknown asymmetry in the laws of physics, there was a slight excess of particles over antiparticles. This excess of particles is what makes up all the matter in the universe today. The asymmetry in the laws of physics that caused this excess is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics. The majority of positive charge in the universe is in the form of protons, while the majority of negative charge is in the form of electrons. In an atom, the protons are concentrated in the center, forming the nucleus, while the electrons are spread out in orbitals around the nucleus. The electrons are held in place by the electromagnetic force between the positive protons and the negative electrons. Note that while protons are positive and electrons are negative, this assignment of charge signs is arbitrary. In fact, the assignment of charge signs was done before the discovery of the electron. All charge in the universe is a multiple of the elementary charge . Protons have a charge of , electrons have a charge of , and neutrons have no charge. Protons are part of a class of particles called hadrons, and they have an internal structure made up of three quarks. Namely, a proton is made up of two up quarks (each with a charge of ) and one down quark (with a charge of ). If, then, an isolated quark exists, it would violate the quantization of charge. However, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) prevents the existence of isolated quarks. As we briefly mentioned earlier, we will mostly ignore the quantization of charge in classical electromagnetism. Instead, we act like a charge, , can take on any value, and we can talk about the charge density at any point in space. The charge density can be thought of as an \"average\" charge per unit volume, in the same way that mass density is the \"average\" mass per unit volume. We will also treat the particles simply as point charges. Experiments have shown that protons and electrons are much smaller than the smallest distances we can measure, so treating them as point charges is a good approximation.","s":"The Charge in Matter","u":"/notes/science/physics/Electromagnetism/Electrostatics/Thinking about Charge","h":"#the-charge-in-matter","p":1161},{"i":1170,"t":"Charge, like many other quantities in physics, is conserved.

(This will be a highly contentious point in the future when we discuss the invariance of charge.) Note that this does not mean that charge is always equal in all parts of a system. For example, in a circuit, charge can flow from one part of the circuit to another, even though the total charge in the circuit remains constant. Another example is a photon's ability to create an electron-positron pair, which, although it changes the charge of the system, does not violate the conservation of charge because the photon itself carries no charge. Conservation laws, such as the conservation of charge, are fundamental to physics. Some advanced mathematical theories, such as Noether's theorem, show that conservation laws actually arise from certain symmetries in the universe.

In order to make an educated guess for the solution of the differential equation, we can use both the form of the differential equation and our knowledge of the system: In a spring-mass system, or any other system that exhibits simple harmonic motion, we know that the system oscillates back and forth around the equilibrium position.

The ball's height above the ground, , can be modelled by a function of time, . The graph above shows the height of the ball as a function of time. Note that the left-right axis does not represent left-right motion; it represents time - rightwards is the future, and leftwards is the past. Now imagine you want to know how fast the ball is moving. One way to do this is to calculate the average rate of change of the height function over a small interval of time. This means we take the difference in height between two points on the graph, , and divide it by the difference in time, . To calculate these differences, denote the starting time as and the ending time as . Then, we can calculate the difference in height as , and the difference in time as simply . The average rate of change is then given by: The expression on the right is sometimes called the difference quotient. We can model this as the slope of a line connecting the two points on the graph. This line is called the secant line: There are two important points to note about the average rate of change: The rate of change isn't just the slope; the slope is a representation of the rate of change. When we study higher-level mathematics, such as multivariable calculus, we will see that the rate of change can be more complex than just measuring slopes. The way we can think of it is that the answer to \"how fast is the ball moving between and \" is \"it's equal to the slope of the secant line between and \". It's just a way to calculate the rate of change. Sometimes we hear the word \"gradient\" used instead of \"slope\". In calculus, the gradient is actually a different term reserved for a different concept (multivariable calculus). Hence, it's better to stick with \"slope\" when talking about the rate of change of a function to avoid confusion.","s":"Average Rate of Change","u":"/notes/maths/Calculus 1 and 2/Differentiation/Rates of Change","h":"#average-rate-of-change","p":1257},{"i":1264,"t":"The average rate of change gives us a good idea of how fast something is changing over a period of time. However, what if we want to know how fast something is changing at a single instant in time? Before even considering how to calculate this, let's first think about what it means. The question \"how fast is something changing at a single instant\" is a bit of a paradox. After all, how can something change at a single instant? It's like asking how fast a car is moving at a single point in time - it doesn't make sense. Speedometers in cars don't measure speed at a single instant; they measure speed over a very short period of time. Think of it like this: the speedometer measures the position now, as well as the position seconds ago. Then, it calculates the average speed over that time period. Let's take the same approach with the height of the ball - make very small. Go back to the graph of the ball's height above the ground, and drag the second point closer to the first point. As the two points get closer together, the secant line becomes more and more like a tangent line, which touches the curve at a single point. In order to calculate the instantaneous rate of change, we need to make as small as possible. Of course, we can't make it exactly zero, because then we'd be dividing by zero. This should immediately ring a bell - limits. Although we cannot set to , we can take the limit as approaches : This limit of the difference quotient gives us the instantaneous rate of change of the function at a particular point. It's also called the derivative of the function at that point. The key point is that instantaneous really just means very, very close to 0. We denote the derivative of this function as , which reads as \"the derivative of with respect to \". Using instead of indicates that the limit is \"built in\" into the expression. This notation is called Leibniz notation, named after the mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Another common notation for the derivative is , which reads the same as \"the derivative of with respect to \". This is called prime notation, and is a shorthand for the derivative. It's a bit more concise than Leibniz notation, but it doesn't explicitly show the variable with respect to which the derivative is taken, which can be a disadvantage especially in the future when we deal with functions of multiple variables. This gives us the formal definition of the derivative, sometimes called the first principle of differentiation: The derivative of a function at a point is given by: It's important to note that the derivative of a function is another function. It gives the rate of change of the original function at every point. For example, gives the rate of change of the height of the ball at time . If a function is explicitly stated, we can substitute the in the notation with the expression of the function. For example, if , then the derivative can be written as or , where can be though of as an operator that transforms a function into its derivative.","s":"Instantaneous Rate of Change","u":"/notes/maths/Calculus 1 and 2/Differentiation/Rates of Change","h":"#instantaneous-rate-of-change","p":1257},{"i":1266,"t":"We will try to answer the following question algebraically: Calculate the derivative of the following functions: , where is a positive integer To calculate the derivative of , we need to use the definition of the derivative.

It allows for the approximation of a non-polynomial function using a polynomial. Polynomials are easy to compute, manipulate, differentiate, and integrate, so approximating a function with a polynomial can make it much easier to work with. To start, consider a function . Assume this is part of some physics problem, and the existence of a term is making the problem difficult to solve. Let's say we are interested in the value of near , and we want to approximate it with a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic function). Denote the quadratic function as . Play around with the sliders below to see how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients a_0, a_1, and a_2: Options Consider how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients , , and . The goal is to find the coefficients that make as close as possible to near . First, consider evaluated at : We want the value of to be the same as at . Hence, one of the coefficients is already determined. Changing the other coefficients will affect the function but will not change the value of . Next, we want the slope of to be the same as the slope of at . This ensures that the value of is close to not only at but also in the neighborhood of ; it doesn't drift too far away from . Now, both the position and the slope of are locked as the same as at . The only thing left is to make sure the concavity of is the same as the concavity of at . Now we have found the coefficients , , and . The quadratic functoin is then: The quadratic function is a good approximation of near . As we add more terms to the polynomial, we can get even closer to the original function. For example, we can add two more terms to get a degree 4 polynomial: The coefficients and can be determined in a similar way as we did for . We take the third and fourth derivatives of at and set them equal to the corresponding derivatives of at . Notice what happens when we take the third derivative of the term in : Notice we are multiplying by by by . This is the same as taking the factorial of : Recall that we want this to be equal to the third derivative of at . Thus: And as such, we can solve for : We get a similar result for : Thus, the degree 4 polynomial approximation of is: Notice that adding the higher degree term does not affect the previous terms. For instance, the concavity of is still the same as the concavity of at . Why? When we take the derivative of a term with a higher power of , the power of decreases by one. The concavity is the second derivative, so the power of decreases by two - so it doesn't become a constant term. Recall that we set . As such, if there is an term in the polynomial, it will be multiplied by zero, and the term will disappear. Hence, each individual coefficient is the \"control\" for a specific order derivative of the function. For a value of near , the polynomial is a good approximation of . Next, consider approximating with a polynomial near some value . Then, the polynomial would be written as: Instead of , we use as the variable, such that the point is treated like . This means that if you plug in , things will cancel. We can keep adding more terms to the polynomial to get a better approximation of near a value of . The derivatives of follow a pattern of at . As such, the coefficients of the polynomial will follow a similar pattern: Next, we can generalize this to any function : And to any value : We have just derived the Taylor series for any function centered at .

If you set as the mass, you could measure the rate of change of mass, , to determine how much fluid is leaking out. Now, let's consider a vector field that represents the flow of a fluid. The vector field could represent the velocity of the fluid at any point in space. If we have a closed curve in space, can we predict how much fluid is flowing outwards through the curve? This quantity is known as the flux of the vector field through the curve . Denoted as , the flux is a scalar quantity that represents the flow of the vector field through the curve.

As we know, these vectors are in 3D space, but the proof can be generalized to any dimension. We can express the dot product of and as: By the distributivity of the dot product over vector addition, we can expand this expression into the sum of the dot products of the individual components. This is analogous to how we expand the product of two binomials; . Notice that in the product of the two binomials, each term is the product of one term from the first binomial and one term from the second binomial. We get every possible combination of terms from the two binomials. This is the same for trinomials; . Applying this to the dot product of and , we get a similar expansion: Recall from the previous section on the corollaries of the dot product that the dot product of two basis vectors is 1 if they are the same and 0 if they are different. As such, all the terms in the expansion where the basis vectors are different will evaluate to 0, and the terms where the basis vectors are the same will evaluate to 1: Since this proof starts with the geometric definition of the dot product and derives the component definition, it shows that the two definitions are equivalent: Hence, the equivalence is proven. As mentioned earlier, this proof can be generalized to any dimension using the same principles. The key idea is to expand the dot product of two vectors into the sum of the dot products of their components, and then use the properties of the dot product to simplify the expression. There are a few interesting things to note about this proof: Notice that this is independent of the cosine rule. This means that we can actually derive the cosine rule from the dot product, rather than the other way around. This proof gives you an explicit formula to get the magnitude of a vector. In the previous proof, we just assumed that the magnitude squared gives you . But this proof shows this independently. Not only is this also a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, but this proof is also especially important when we consider vector spaces without an orthonormal basis. In such cases, the magnitude is not just , but something else. These situations are more common than one would think, especially in fields such as relativity and quantum mechanics.

Instead, it treats the act of projection as a linear transformation and shows that the computation of this transformation is equivalent to the component definition of the dot product. This proof originates from 3b1b's series on linear algebra. It's a very interesting way to think about the dot product. Imagine that we do not know anything about the dot product, only that it does some kind of projection. Let be some unit vector that we want to project onto. Essentially, we are turning this two-dimensional onto a line defined by . Hence, this is a transformation from to . Start (Note that this line is just a visual representation of the projection; it does not actually \"sit\" in this 2D space.) Recall that linear transformations are defined by how they act on the basis vectors. Since we want to project it onto a line, each column in the matrix representing the transformation would only have one entry. Call this matrix : Recall that each column in the matrix represents the result of applying the transformation to the basis vectors. To find these columns, we can zoom in on the diagram above. Below is the projection of onto the line: Here's the key part: the projection of onto the line, , is exactly the same as the projection of onto . We can see this visually by creating a line of symmetry between the two vectors: But the projection of onto is just the -component of : Thus, the projection of onto is the same as the projection of onto , which is . The same applies for the projection of onto , which is . Thus, the matrix is: Notice what happened here: we have a transformation that takes a vector and projects it onto a line. This transformation is represented by a matrix, and the matrix is the dot product of the vector with the basis vectors. But notice that this transformation is exactly the same as what the dot product does. Now, we can apply this transformation to any arbitrary vector . This is the same as the component definition of the dot product. Hence, the equivalence is proven. Note: What we have derived here has a name: covectors, or dual vectors. Essentially, when a linear transformation maps to , it can be represented as a row vector. Then, if we \"tip\" this row vector over, we can express this transformation as a dot product. This vector that corresponds to the linear transformation is precisely what we call a covector.","s":"Dot Product as a Linear Transformation","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Vectors II/Dot Product Equivalence of Definitions","h":"#dot-product-as-a-linear-transformation","p":1439},{"i":1452,"t":"The component definition of the dot product, as shown in the second proof, is only valid for orthonormal vectors.

The probability of measuring the electron in the spin-up state after the second SG apparatus is: Conversely, the probability of measuring the electron in the spin-down state is: In other words, the electron will always be measured in the spin-up state in the second -SG apparatus.

To see why we want the determinant to be , we need to consider the Born rule. The probability of measuring a state in an eigenstate is given by . If was transformed by a phase shift to , then the probability of measuring in would be . In other words, the phase shift does not affect the probabilities. This is analogous to the transformation of the Jones vectors. Global phase shifts do not change the polarization of light; they only change the overall phase of the wave. The set of Jones vectors can be represented as a sphere called the Poincaré sphere. Similarly, the set of spin states can be represented as a sphere called the Bloch sphere. Notice that in the Bloch sphere, and are apart, yet in physical space, they are orthogonal. In other words, there is an angle-doubling effect when mapping the Bloch sphere to physical space. This makes the spin state ket a spinor. I claimed that both the Jones vectors and spin states are spinors, but we have not yet defined what a spinor is. What we have seen so far is that a spinor does not care about its phase and that it transforms using a specific set of matrices. This leads us to a preliminary definition: A spinor is a column vector that (1) has phase ambiguity and (2) transforms using matrices.

Specifically, a qubit is a two-level quantum system that can be in a superposition of the two states, just like the electron in the SG experiment. Qubits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum computers, and they can be used to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. To see why, consider a classical computer with bits. The computer can be in one of states. A quantum computer with qubits can be in a superposition of these states (which is much more than states). Then, if we have multiple qubits (where the whole system is a tensor product of the individual qubits), this scales exponentially. When we apply an unitary operator - physically, a quantum gate - to a set of qubits, each possible state of the qubits is transformed by the same operator. This means that we are essentially performing multiple computations with a single operation. Even more interesting things happen when we consider entanglement, where the states of the qubits are correlated with each other, and the whole system cannot be written as a tensor product of the individual qubits.","s":"Qubits and Quantum Computing","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/Mathematical Foundations/Applying to Spin 12 Systems","h":"#qubits-and-quantum-computing","p":1475},{"i":1490,"t":"In this section, we applied the state vector formalism to spin-1/2 systems.

These include: A quantity like (position) is just a single number. Quantities can never have multiple values simultaneously. A particle cannot be at two places at once, nor can it have two different momenta. The state of a system is completely determined by specifying the values of all such quantities. These quantities are continuous, meaning that there are no gaps between possible values. This is intuitively true because particles cannot just jump instantly from one position to another. The state of a system can be known with arbitrary precision. These assumptions make it natural to represent the state of a system using a continous function. For example, the position of a particle can be represented by a function that gives the position of the particle at each time . Quantum mechanics, however, challenges these assumptions: It introduces the concept of superposition, where a particle can exist in multiple states at once. For example, a particle can be in a superposition of being at two different positions simultaneously. It introduces the concept of quantization, where certain quantities can only take on discrete values. For example, the energy of an electron in an atom can only take on certain discrete values, or, if you have read the section on the Stern Gerlach Experiment, the spin of an electron can only be up or down. It introduces the concept of uncertainty, where the state of a system cannot be known with arbitrary precision. This is encapsulated in the various uncertainty principles. Clearly, we cannot use continuous functions to represent the state of a system in quantum mechanics. Suppose that we want to write down the state of a particle using its energy (for example, the energy of an electron in an atom). Assume that, at an energy level of exactly , the particle's state is described by some object . We do not currently know what this object is, but we know that it represents the state of the particle at energy level . Of course, there are multiple outcomes for the energy of the particle, each corresponding to a different state . We can write the state of the particle by combining these states with an unknown operation: Each state also has its own probability - some states are more likely than others. Hence, it's also appropriate to introduce a scaling factor for each state : It turns out, the operation is just addition, and introducing scale factors makes the state a linear combination of the states . Since we can add and scale the states , they form a vector space, and is a vector in this space. A vector inside these brackets, , is called a ket. This is the fundamental idea behind the state vector formalism in quantum mechanics. The state of a system is represented by a vector in a vector space, and the state can be a linear combination of multiple basis states. The reason we do not use the usual notation for vectors (like ) will become clear later. If the representation of everything about a system with object is not clear, know that this is a common pattern in physics. Later on, we will see that we can do the same in classical mechanics, where we can represent everything about a system with the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian.","s":"How do We Represent States?","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/Mathematical Foundations/Hilbert Spaces and Dirac Notation","h":"#how-do-we-represent-states","p":1491},{"i":1497,"t":"In quantum mechanics, we represent physical quantities like position, momentum, and energy using operators. As shown previously, the state of a system is represented by a state vector . One might guess that to find some physical quantity of the system, we can use a matrix to operate on the state vector. This matrix is called an operator. For example, the position operator acts on the state vector to give the position of the particle. It is denoted as . The wavefunction is a complex-valued function that represents the state of a system. As shown previously, it is formed by combining different states with scaling factors : This sum is called a superposition of states. But of course, some quantities can take on an infinite number of values. A particle can theoretically take on any energy level, so we need to sum over an infinite number of states: For a continuous quantity, like position, we need to sum over an uncountably infinite number of states. This means that the sum becomes an integral: It turns out that is the position wavefunction, . For another quantity, like momentum, we would have a different wavefunction , called the momentum wavefunction. Therefore, for any physical quantity , we can define a wavefunction that represents the state of the system in that quantity's space: The state vectors that are used to represent the state of the system are called basis states. Recall from linear algebra that the dimensionality of a vector space is the number of basis states required to span the space. But if there are an infinite number of basis states, the vector space is infinite-dimensional. This raises a problem. To illustrate, consider a vector space represented by the set of all polynomials. The basis states are the monomials , and polynomials are linear combinations of these basis states. But observe this following infinite polynomial: This infinite polynomial turns out to be , which is not a polynomial. Hence, an infinite sum of polynomials can give a function that is not a polynomial. In order for the wavefunction to be a valid representation of the state of the system, we must add one more condition: a limit of a sequence/series of state vectors must converge to a state vector in the space. This is known as Cauchy completeness, and it ensures that the space of state vectors is valid. Let's summarize the properties of the vector space of state vectors: The state of a system is represented by a state vector . The state vector is a linear combination of basis states . The basis states form an infinite-dimensional vector space. The vector space is Cauchy complete, meaning that the limit of a sequence of state vectors converges to a state vector in the space. This vector space that we have just described is almost the definition of a Hilbert space .

For instance, if both particles are in the state, the state of the system is , where is something we will define later. Hence, the basis states of the system are , , , and . The vector space is now four-dimensional, which can be thought of as the \"product\" of the two two-dimensional spaces.

Defining a dot product helps us define angles between vectors, as well as lengths and projections.

Suppose and are two state vectors in the space of state vectors. The inner product is denoted as . Just like the dot product, the inner product is a way to multiply two vectors to get a scalar.

Most operators cannot be represented as outer products, since they are just projection operators. For a more concrete explanation, consider the matrix multiplication that forms the outer product - notice that both columns are scaled versions of the input vector. This means that they are linearly dependent, and so the matrix is singular (i.e. it has a determinant of zero). This is why operators must be represented as a linear combination of outer products, rather than just a single outer product. Similarly, some coupled systems cannot be represented as the tensor product of individual systems. Systems that cannot be represented as the tensor product of individual systems are called entangled systems.

Instead of thinking about the position of each mass, we think about the displacement of the spring at each position. This is a field - a function of position and time. We will now apply a fundamental shift in our thinking. Since kinetic energy is a quantity for a single particle, it does not make sense to talk about the kinetic energy in this case. Instead, we will think about the kinetic energy density - the kinetic energy per unit length: Similarly, the potential energy density is the potential energy per unit length: We will make some changes to simplify the problem: Let for simplicity.

The Hamiltonian is a function of the generalized coordinates and generalized momenta , which are related to the position and momentum of the particles in the system. The total mechanical energy of a system is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies: In Hamiltonian mechanics, it is convenient to visualize and as a pair of coordinates on a plane known as the Phase space. The phase space is a 2D space where each point represents a possible state of the system. Over time, the system moves through the phase space, tracing out a path known as the trajectory. We can define any quantity based on the position and momentum of the system. For instance, for a mass-spring system, we can define the potential as . The Poisson bracket is a mathematical operation that describes how two quantities evolve over time. For two quantities and , the Poisson bracket is defined as: The Poisson bracket is a measure of how two quantities change with respect to each other.

This means that purely logically, we can derive any result in electrostatics using these two principles. To demosntrate this, we will now solve some a basic problem involving Coulomb's Law and the electric field. There are two goals for basic problems problems like this: To understand how to apply Coulomb's Law and the formula for the electric field to solve problems. To realize that this is a f***ing pain in the a** and we need a better way to do this. The problem is as follows: A solid sphere of radius has a charge uniformly distributed throughout its surface. Find the electric field at a point that is units above the center of the sphere. You will need to use the cosine rule to solve this problem. You will end up with two cases, one where the point is inside the sphere and one where the point is outside the sphere. To solve this problem, we will need to integrate the electric field over the entire surface of the sphere. We shall use spherical coordinates to simplify the calculation. We shall consider a small surface element on the sphere, then use the surface charge density to calculate the charge in this element. The charge density is the charge per unit area, i.e. how much charge is present per unit area of the surface. Since it is uniformly distributed, the charge density is constant and equal to: The surface element is a small patch on the sphere shown below: The area of this surface element is its width times its height, which is . Therefore, the charge in this surface element is: This charge contributes to the electric field at the point . Call this contribution . The key idea is that the contribution is only along the radial (vertical) direction. This is due to the symmetry of the sphere, which means that there is another point, , on the opposite side of the sphere that contributes an equal and opposite electric field in the horizontal direction. A diagram of this is shown below: So we only need to consider the vertical component of the electric field; . To find this component, we need: The charge in the surface element. We already know this to be . The distance from the surface element to the point . We do not know this yet. (I use instead of since looks weird in .) We can construct a triangle with the surface element, the point , and the center of the sphere. This triangle is shown below: We can now find the distance using the cosine rule. (Recall that is the angle from the vertical axis to the point .) With this, we can find the electric field at the point due to the surface element. Remember that only the vertical component of the electric field contributes to the electric field at . We shall use for simplicity. The total electric field at the point is then the sum of the electric fields due to all the surface elements. This is an integral over the entire surface of the sphere. The bounds are and . The angle is the angle between the electric field and the vertical axis. From the cosine rule on we have: To simplify the integral, we can make the subject instead of . By the cosine rule and implicit differentiation, we have: Now, regarding the bounds of the integral, we can visualize from to . (You could calculate the bounds with brute force, but this is a more elegant way to do it.) At , the charge is at the top of the sphere. The diagram below shows for both and : Evidently, the bounds are and . (For , the lower bound of is , while for , the lower bound is .) The upper bound is for both cases: Using both equations, we can rewrite the integral as: From here, it depends on whether or . For , we have : Recall that for a point charge at a distance from the center of the sphere, the electric field is . So the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , we have : So the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Our conclusions are: For , the electric field at a point units above the center of the sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center of the sphere. For , the electric field at a point units below the center of the sphere is zero. Notice how absolutely painful this was. We had to do a complicated spherical integral, and then we had to use a bunch of trigonometry to simplify the result. Any algebraic mistake would have resulted in a wrong answer. And this is all just for a simple sphere with a uniform charge distribution. Imagine doing this for a more complex charge distribution.

We can create a path between two points by defining a function that describes the path, where we can think of as time. Suppose this path lives in two-dimensional space, so .

Consider the following vector field: Start In this case, the water is flowing out of the region. In this case, the divergence is positive. Note that a positive divergence doesn't mean that all the water is flowing out of the region. It just means that more water is flowing out than in. For example, the divergence here is also positive: Start Regions where the divergence is positive are called sources. In the water example, the source could be from a fountain. Next, consider the following vector field: Start We flipped the vector field, so now the water is flowing into the region, and the divergence is negative. Regions where the divergence is negative are called sinks. In the water example, the sink could be a drain. Of course, this is not how water works in real life. Going back to the first example: Start Notice that at any region, there's no net flow of water. The water is flowing out of the region as much as it is flowing into the region.

Recall that the divergence is still positive: Notice that the slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. The last scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the left, and some water flowing in from the right. The slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. In this case, it's very negative at the left, and at the right, it is still negative, but less so. Hence, It should be clear from these scenarios that: Hence, the partial derivative is somehow related to the divergence. We can apply the same logic for the component of the vector field: In this case, the water will only flow vertically.

With this, we can plot some vectors representing the curl alongside the vector field: Notice that in areas of clockwise rotation, the curl is negative (points in the direction), and in areas of counterclockwise rotation, the curl is positive (points in the direction). The curl is a vector that purely exists in the direction. Hence, a prototype for the 3D curl could be, for a vector field : However this does not fully capture the curl, since it only works on a 2D vector field. To generalize this more, we need to do this for a vector field in 3D space. Recall our original vector field : This results, as we've seen, in a vector field that lies on a plane. Consider \"copying\" this vector for every value: Of course, only some of the vectors are visible. In reality, for every value, there is a plane in which the vector field exists. Thus, the vector field can be thought of as a volume in 3D space: We have: Added a third input to the vector field, .

This should also make sense intuitively; a zero second derivative means that the slope is constant throughout the function, so the function should never curve. Consider the following scalar field: With a constant value, the function is simply an exponential, and with a nonconstant value, the function is an exponential that sort of oscillates. Consider the Laplacion of this scalar field: If we plot the scalar field , it doesn't look like a straight line, but it is a harmonic function: To show why this is harmonic, consider the single-variable case again: In a point where , the function is concave up. This means that the points around it are higher than the point itself. Even in a situation where the function has a positive slope: While there are points that are lower than the point itself, on average, the points around it are higher. Next, generalize this to a scalar field. If the Laplacian is nonzero, then it means that around the point, its neighbors are higher/lower than the point itself on average: If the Laplacian is positive (), then the neighbors are higher than the point itself on average. If the Laplacian is negative (), then the neighbors are lower than the point itself on average. The function we have is harmonic; the Laplacian is zero. This means that on average, the point's neighbors are at the same height as the point itself. Laplacians come up in many areas of physics, and this concept of the neighbors' height does have physical significance. For example, if you were considering heat flow, then you would consider the heat around the point to evaluate how the heat is distributed.

A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. For example, consider the vectors: The third vector can be written as a linear combination of the first two vectors: Another way to think of it is, you can make a combination of the three vectors that equals the zero vector: If you can find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, then the vectors are linearly dependent. If you can't find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, then the vectors are linearly independent. Implications of Linear Dependence​ If a set of vectors is linearly dependent, then it means that one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. This means that one of the vectors is redundant, and you can remove it without losing any information. For example, consider some GPS software that says \"Go 3 miles north, then 4 miles south.\" This is like saying \"Go , then .\" The two vectors are linearly dependent because you can linearly combine them to get . This means we can describe the north vector in terms of the south vector, or vice versa. Therefore, we can remove one of them without losing any information. The GPS can instead simply say \"Go 1 mile south.\" Consider another instruction: \"Go 2 miles north, then 2 miles east.\" This is like saying \"Go , then .\" These two vectors are linearly independent because you can't combine them to get . We cannot describe the north vector in terms of the east vector, or vice versa. This means that both vectors are necessary to describe the movement. The GPS can also say \"Go 2.8 miles northeast.\" This would be a linear combination of the two vectors. Linear Dependence to Determine Span​ If you have a set of vectors and you want to determine if they span a space, you can check if they are linearly independent. If they are linearly independent, then they span , and if not, they don't. Proof Let be vectors in the vector space . Assume that . This means that there exists a vector in that is not in .

To determine if the vectors are linearly dependent, we need to see if there's a way to combine them to get the zero vector: Since we want to find a set of scalars that aren't all zero, we can pick a random value, like : Now we can substitute and back into the second equation: We found three scalars that aren't all zero yet satisfy the equation: Therefore, the vectors are linearly dependent. Alternatively, let's consider a logical approach. For 3 vectors in , in the best case scenario, two of the vectors are linearly independent.

Observables are quantities that can be measured, and they are represented by Hermitian operators. Here are the key points to remember: Observables are quantities that can be measured in quantum mechanics. They correspond to \"real-life\" or physical quantities. Their eigenvectors form a basis representing the possible outcomes of the observable, and their eigenvalues are the values of the observable. After making a measurement, the state vector collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. By intuition, observables have the following three properties: The eigenvalues of an observable are real numbers. The eigenvectors of an observable form a complete basis. The eigenvectors of an observable are orthogonal. The operators can be written as a sum of their eigenvectors and eigenvalues: In the continuous case, this becomes an integral: The operator is known as the projector onto the eigenvector . It is sometimes denoted as . The Born rule states that the probability of measuring an observable with eigenvalue is . It followed intuitively from a few key insights about the nature of observables and the conditions for probabilities. Namely, they must sum to in all bases, and they must preserve the norm of the state vector in all bases. The adjoint of an operator is the operator that is used for the dual correspondence between vectors and linear functionals. The adjoint of is denoted as , and is defined such that . Operators that are equal to their Hermitian adjoints are known as Hermitian operators. Hermitian adjoints have the following properties: Applying the Hermitian adjoint twice gives the original operator. The adjoint of a sum of operators is the sum of the adjoints. The adjoint of a product of operators is the product of the adjoints in reverse order. The adjoint of a scalar is its complex conjugate. The adjoint of an operator \"flips\" its input and output spaces. Operators representing observables are Hermitian operators. The expectation value of an observable in a state is the average value of the observable when measured many times. It is denoted as and is given by . In the next chapter, we will take a brief detour to discuss Poisson brackets in classical mechanics, and then link them to commutators in quantum mechanics, from which we will derive the uncertainty principle. Afterwards, we will discuss how operators can be represented as matrices, and how they can be diagonalized to find their eigenvectors and eigenvalues.","s":"Summary and Next Steps","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/Mathematical Foundations/Observables and Operators","h":"#summary-and-next-steps","p":2004},{"i":2031,"t":"Quantum Sense, \"Maths of Quantum Mechanics\", a Youtube Playlist.

Theorem: In a finite-dimensional Hilbert space , the Hermitian adjoint of a ket vector is its corresponding bra vector , which is the linear functional that is dual to the inner product . Proof. Recall that Hermitian adjoints act on operators, not vectors. It would thus seem like we need to somehow interpret a vector as a linear transformation. This comes from our dual correspondence, where a vector can be thought of as a linear functional. In fact, let's define this formally - for a vector , we can write its corresponding linear functional as . is a linear functional that takes a scalar and outputs a vector. The simplest form of is just to have it scale the vector by the input scalar: With this definition, is known as the Canonical isomorphism between a Hilbert space and its dual space . Now that we have an idea of what it means to interpret a vector as a linear transformation, we can see what it means to take the adjoint of said transformation. Since this transformation is , its adjoint is (by the 5th property of the Hermitian adjoint). We already know that linear functionals are also , so it seems like the adjoint of a vector is a bra (linear functional). But is it exactly the bra , the one that corresponds to ? We can see this by taking the product of the adjoint of a vector with another vector (which should output a scalar): Since is also an inner product space, it is the same thing as , where I added a subscript to the inner product to denote that it is the inner product in . By the definition of the Hermitian adjoint, this is equal to (notice that the inner product changed from to ).

So all this is equal to , which is precisely the inner product of and . Thus, , and so . One might rightfully ask how this can be extended to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This is easier to see if we restrict ourselves to continuous linear functionals. Then, the Riesz representation theorem automatically gives us a bra vector for every ket vector. Outside of continuous linear functionals, the correspondence is not as clear. I will not delve into this, but the author of this post has a good explanation of this in a comment on the linked post.

In classical mechanics, we would expect the magnetic field to exert a force on the atoms, causing them to deflect. Stern-Gerlach Experiment By Tatoute - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, Link The Stern-Gerlach experiment was designed to test this prediction. In the setup, a furnace heats up silver atoms (1 in the image). They escape through a small hole and travel through a collimator (2), which ensures that the beam is narrow and well-defined. Then, the beam passes through an inhomogeneous magnetic field, which causes the atoms to deflect. (An inhomogeneous magnetic field is a magnetic field that varies in strength and direction over space.) The electronic configuration of silver atoms is (in the ground state). Other than the electron, all other electrons are paired up, so they don't contribute to the angular momentum. Below, I will provide two explanations for the classical prediction for the Stern-Gerlach experiment: one using some mathematical machinery and the other using an intuitive analogy. Mathematical Explanation Intuitive Explanation Let the electron spin angular momentum be . The magnetic moment of the electron is proportional to the angular momentum, so we can write: The energy of the interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic field is given by: Therefore, the force on the atom is given by the gradient of the energy: If we assume that the magnetic field is in the -direction, then the force on the atom is given by: According to classical mechanics, since the atom can have any orientation of the magnetic moment, the -component of the magnetic moment can have any value from to . Therefore, the force on the atom can have any value from to . We would expect the beam to spread out in the -direction (4 in the image). Magnetic forces appear when charge is moving. For example, when a current flows through a wire, a magnetic field is generated around the wire. This is how electromagnets work; you coil a wire around a piece of iron, and when you pass a current through the wire, the iron becomes magnetic. In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the south-pole of a magnet is placed at the top, above the north-pole of another magnet. The key point is that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, meaning it varies in strength and direction over space. Specifically, the south-pole part is much stronger than the north-pole part. This means that the magnetic field is stronger at the top than at the bottom. Suppose you throw a bar magnet into a SG apparatus setup. If it has its north pole pointing up, there would be a strong attraction towards the south pole at the top, and a weaker attraction towards the north pole at the bottom. Hence, the bar magnet would be pulled up. Conversely, if the bar magnet has its south pole pointing up, there would be a strong repulsion from the south pole at the top, and a weaker repulsion from the north pole at the bottom. Hence, the bar magnet would be pushed down. If the bar magnet is tilted slightly, it would experience a force that is a combination of the two. Overall, its path would be curved, and it would hit the screen at a point that corresponds to the combination of the two forces. Since you can continuously tilt the bar magnet, you would expect to see a continuous distribution of spots on the screen. During the times of the SG experiment, the Bohr model of the atom was prevalent. In it, the electron orbits the nucleus in a circular path. Silver atoms have one unpaired electron in the 5th shell - this means that there is charge moving in a circular path. And as I said, a moving charge experiences magnetic forces. In fact, we can model the entire atom as a tiny bar magnet. Therefore, we would expect the beam to spread out in the -direction. Instead, what happens is that the beam splits into two distinct beams, and only two spots are observed on the screen (5 in the image). This means that in reality, the magnetic moment can only have two values: and . In other words, the angular momentum of the electron can only have two values. Let's call these values the \"up\" state and the \"down\" state . This is a direct contradiction to classical mechanics, which predicts that the magnetic moment can have any value between and .","s":"The Setup and its Results","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/Stern Gerlach Experiment","h":"#the-setup-and-its-results","p":2036},{"i":2043,"t":"Now, let's consider what happens when we pass the beam through another Stern-Gerlach apparatus.

Light is an electromagnetic wave, and the electric field of the wave can oscillate in any direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The direction of oscillation is called the polarization of the light. Note that we are using light purely as an analogy to the Stern-Gerlach experiment, in hopes of creating a mathematical framework that can describe both phenomena. In this analogy, we treat light purely classically as an electromagnetic wave. There is a lot to say about the quantum nature of polarization - watch this video for more. In fact, watch it even if you don't care about the quantum nature of polarization. If a light beam is -polarized, its equation can be written as: It is often convenient to use complex notation to represent the electric field. Of course, the physical electric field is real, but the complex notation simplifies calculations. We can also add a phase factor to the electric field: A -polarized light beam can be written similarly as: More generally, an electric field can be written as a linear combination of and polarizations: We can separate the exponential and the polarization vector: The vector is called the Jones vector. In order to get -polarized light, we need to pass the light through a polarizer that only allows light oscillating in the -direction to pass through. We can call this an -filter. In a similar manner to the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we can pass light through a series of filters and observe the polarization of the light: Case 1: Pass through -filter, then -filter. In this case, the light will be -polarized after the first filter. Then, no light will pass through the -filter, as it only allows -polarized light to pass through. Thus, the light will be completely blocked. Case 2: Pass through -filter, then a -filter, then -filter. In this case, there will actually be light passing through the -filter. Let's examine the second case in more detail. Denote the direction of the -filter as . Once the -filter is applied, the light will be -polarized regardless of the initial polarization. Doesn't this seem familiar to the Stern-Gerlach experiment? SG Experiment Light Experiment After SG apparatus: Lose spin information After filter: Lose polarization information atoms , -polarized light atoms , -polarized light The basis vectors and are rotated versions of and , as shown below: The key is that once light passes through an -filter, its polarization is somewhere on the -axis, meaning it has a component in the -direction. But this also means that it has a component in the -direction. More precisely speaking, we can write down the coordinate transformation: Another way of thinking about it is that mathematically, a filter simply projects the Jones vector onto the basis vector of the filter. Since we can represent the polarization of light as a vector as we have seen, perhaps we can use the same vector representation for the spin of particles. Of course, this means that the particles have a property that can be represented as a vector in a two-dimensional space. We can write the spin of a particle as a vector in a two-dimensional space. In the -direction, we have the and states, and in the -direction, we have the and states. Just like the polarization, we can rotate the spin states to get the and states: Next, how do we represent spin in the -direction? By symmetry, if we pass in the -direction through a -SG apparatus, it should yield the same result as passing in the -direction through an -SG apparatus.

To understand this better, let's get a deeper understanding of the Jones vector. Recall that the Jones vector can be represented by combining the and polarizations: Circular polarization occurs when there is a phase difference between the and components. For example, consider the simple case where and are both and and . Then, the Jones vector is: Options Samples Position slice Show Hide Overall wave Show Hide Jones vector: With imaginary components, it is a bit harder to visualize the Jones vector. If we get the full expression for the electric field, we will see the following: At the point , for example, if and , then the electric field is: Using Euler's formula, we can expand it out and then take the real part: In other words, the electric field rotates in a circle clockwise. Go to the above visualizer and set the following values: , , , , , . If you turn on the \"Position Slice\" option, you will see a slice of the wave at . I have also added vectors representing the horizontal and vertical components of this slice. This wave is left-circularly polarized. If one points their left thumb in the direction of propagation, the electric field will rotate in the direction of the fingers. Overall, the Jones vector for different types of polarization is summarized in the following table: Polarization Jones Vector Linear in Linear in Linear at (diagonal) Linear at (antidiagonal) Linear at Left-circular Right-circular Circular-polarized light can be created by passing linear-polarized light through a quarter-wave plate, which introduces a phase difference between the and components. Notice that if we pass circular-polarized light through a linear polarizer, we still get linear-polarized light, yet circular-polarized light is different from the -polarized light we used previously. This is perfectly analogous to the states we were looking for - ones which are different from the states but behave similarly. This calls for the following correspondence: SG Experiment Light Experiment After SG apparatus: Lose spin information After filter: Lose polarization information atoms , -polarized light atoms , -polarized light atoms Circular-polarized light We can hence write down the states in the same way we wrote down the circular-polarized light:","s":"Circular Polarization","u":"/notes/QFT from Ground Up/Part I Quantum Mechanics/Stern Gerlach Experiment","h":"#circular-polarization","p":2036},{"i":2056,"t":"In the physical world, we transform the polarization of light using wave plates and polarizers. Mathematically, each of these devices corresponds to a transformation on the Jones vector. These transformations can be represented by matrices called Jones matrices. Wave plates are usually birefringent crystals - crystals that have different refractive indices for different polarizations. This means that light slows down differently depending on the direction, and hence have a different phase shift for different polarizations. This causes the phase difference between the and components of the Jones vector to change, hence creating circularly polarized light. A quater wave plate - one that introduces a quarter-cycle phase shift in the -component of the Jones vector - can be represented by the matrix: This changes a diagonal-polarized wave to a left-circular-polarized wave . This can be seen mathematically as follows: The interesting part of this occurs when we keep applying these transformations: In other words, the quarter wave plate matrix allows us to rotate between the different types of polarization in the order . In the matrix, we can also replace with a general phase factor to continuously rotate between the different types of polarization. A visual representation of this polarization space is shown below. Shape of polarized light Abstract polarization space Now imagine that we have the same birefringent crystal, but this time we rotate it by . What kind of polarization will it create? The key is that instead of rotating the birefringent crystal, we can keep it stationary, rotate the light by , and then pass it through the crystal. Then, rotate the light back by and it will be our desired polarization. Mathematically, this is equivalent to applying the following transformations: (1) rotate the light by , (2) apply the quarter wave plate, (3) rotate the light by : An important thing to note is that the factor is a global phase factor - it just moves the entire wave by a constant phase. It does not apply any physical change to the polarization of the wave, so we can actually ignore it. Starting from horizontally polarized light (), we can apply the above transformation multiple times again to get the following: In other words, the rotated quarter wave plate matrix allows us to rotate between the different types of polarization in the order . We can rotate continuously between the different types of polarization by using a generic angle in our original matrix multiplication: Now we have two different matrices that allow us to rotate between the different types of polarization. If we put their circles together, we form a sphere as follows: The transformations are represented by the matrices: Blue transformation Yellow transformation Green transformation ? As you can see, by placing the different polarization states on a sphere, we can identify another transformation that we're missing. This sphere is called the Poincaré sphere. The third transformation is the following: It turns out that these three matrices all belong to the Unitary Group of matrices, denoted as . When we rotate between the different types of polarization on the Poincaré sphere, the magnitude of the Jones vector remains constant. The squared magnitude of a real vector can be written as , where is the Hermitian adjoint of . If is a rotation vector, then applying to should not change the magnitude of . In other words, . Using the properties of the adjoint, we can expand this out to . Hence, , where is the identity matrix. This is the defining property of a unitary matrix. If a matrix has only real entries, then its adjoint is the same as its transpose. Given that a, say, real matrix is unitary, it means that the columns of the matrix form an orthonormal basis. We can see this by taking the adjoint of the matrix and multiplying it by the original matrix. Below is an example of a unitary matrix: These matrices are called orthogonal matrices, and the group of all orthogonal matrices is denoted as . Another type of matrix is a reflection matrix, which flips the sign of one of the basis vectors. It inverts the orientation of space, and hence has a determinant of . If we restrict ourselves to matrices with a determinant of , we get the Special Orthogonal Group of matrices, denoted as . We can see that the matrices are similar to the matrices. The former are complex matrices, while the latter are real matrices with a determinant of . matrices do not necessarily have a determinant of , only its magnitude is preserved. This can be seen by starting from and taking the determinant of both sides: Hence, the determinant can be any complex number with a magnitude of , or where is a real number. We also know that because the global phase shift does not matter, there are multiple matrices that can represent the same transformation. For example, and represent the same transformation. We can isolate one specific matrix by enforcing another constraint - that the determinant of the matrix is exactly . If the determinant of a matrix is , then we can rescale it by to get a matrix with a determinant of .

From the SG experiment, it is clear that angular momentum is quantized. That is, particles can only have certain values of angular momentum. Performing sequential SG experiments in different directions leads to the conclusion that spin states can only exist in one direction. That is, when we measure or set the spin of a particle in one direction, the spin in the other directions is lost. The spin states are similar to the polarization states of light. The states are similar to the and polarizations, while the states are similar to the and polarizations. Mathematically speaking, the two spin states are members of a two-dimensional complex vector space and act as a basis for the space. The states are similar to circularly polarized light. The polarization of light can be represented by the Jones vector, which can be transformed by matrices called Jones matrices. They can be represented in an abstract space known as the Poincaré sphere. Jones matrices are elements of the group, the unitary group of matrices.

Since both the numerator and denominator are integers, the sum of rational numbers is rational; . But the sum of the series above evaluates to , which is irrational.

Predator Growth → Prey Decline - The more foxes there are, the more rabbits they eat, so the rabbit population decreases. Prey Decline → Predator Decline - The less rabbits there are, the less food there is for the foxes, so the fox population decreases.

First, consider the numerator: This is equivalent to a certain cross product. The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors and is . Hence: Isn't the cross product a 3D operation? The cross product is indeed a 3D operation, meaning it's only defined for vectors . However, the cross product can be generalized to 2D vectors by considering them as 3D vectors with a -component of 0. Hence, the proper way to write the cross product is: Instead of considering the cross product itself, which has a direction in 3D space, we consider the magnitude of the cross product, which is a scalar, and makes sense in 2D space. We can consider what both and represent visually. Consider a curve of some parametric equation , and consider points on the curve: For every point on the curve, consider a vector pointing there. Then, the first derivative measures the movement in this vector. If you were to do this for all points, then you get the tangent vector. To visualize , consider plotting the tangent vectors separately, placed at the origin. Then, consider the change in these tangent vectors. In essence, the first derivative measures the change in the tip of the vector function, while the second derivative measures the change in the tangent vector. Consider the cross product of these two vectors. To illustrate what it means, consider tangent vectors on a curve with high curvature: Notice how it's almost a rotation as approaches 0. Hence, the acceleration of the tangent vector would approximately be perpendicular to the tangent vector. In other words, the curvature is essentially how perpendicular the acceleration is to the tangent vector. This should make you instantly think of the cross product, which is exactly what the curvature formula is. Recall that geometrically, the magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. As such, if they're more perpendicular, the area is larger, and hence the curvature is higher, which is exactly what the formula evaluates. So, the curvature can be described as: There's a problem, however. Recall that the curvature is defined as the rate of change with respect to arc length, since the curvature is a property of the curve itself, not the parameterization. This would pose a problem to our makeshift formulation of the curvature, since a higher speed would imply a longer tangent vector, which would imply a higher curvature. For instance, if you double the speed, the tangent vector would double in length, and so will the acceleration. We can instead consider \"shrinking\" the tangent vector to a unit vector: However, for the acceleration vector, we divide by the magnitude of the velocity vector, so that it corresponds to the tangent: Recall that the second derivative tells you how much the tangent vector changes, and the first derivative tells you how much the curve changes. If we want to express everything in terms of the tangent vector, we should divide by the magnitude of the tangent vector.

Recall that these line segments are defined in terms of certain vectors and a parameter . So, to transform this whole set, we need to transform each of these vectors and keep the parameter intact. Below is the visualization for the following transformation: Start Before doing the calculation, let's understand this from an intuitive perspective. Notice how, in the transformed space, the line segments are still line segments. Recall that visually, linear transformations preserve line distances and line parallelism. This is a visual representation of that. Additionally, notice how, both in the original and transformed spaces, the line segments are still connected at the endpoints, and the endpoints are the transformed vectors. This means that to create the new set of line segments, we only need to transform the endpoints of the original line segments. Next, let's prove this mathematically. First, apply the transformation to .

The coefficient matrix is the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in the system of equations: The coefficient matrix is: We can augment the coefficient matrix with the right-hand side of the equations: It might not be immediately clear why we're doing this - we could've just solved the equations directly. One reason is that it just saves time; we won't have to write , , , and every time. We can apply the same operations to the augmented matrix as we would to the system of equations. For example, we can add a multiple of one row to another, or swap two rows. The leading entry in a row is the first non-zero element in the row. We want to make all leading entries 1, and all other entries in the column 0. Additionally, for every row with a leading 1, all other entries in the column should be 0.

Our matrix now satisfies these conditions: Some more terminology to note for this matrix: Each leading 1, as the only non-zero entry in its column, is called a pivot entry. The row with all zero entries is known as the zeroed-out row. By convention, in RREF, the zeroed-out row is at the bottom of the matrix. The process we have just done to achieve RREF is called Gaussian elimination.
