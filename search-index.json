Therefore, change is impossible. Aquinas' act-potency distinction allows him to avoid this problem. However, it also leads to some other problems. First, the act of staying the same is also a kind of change, and can be seen as a kind of potentiality. This means that everything has at least one potential, that of staying the same. This \"everything\" includes the unmoved mover, which means that the unmoved mover is not actually unmoved. Second, many philosophers argue that it leads to an actual infinity of potentials. Consider a fluid in a container at . It has the potential to be at , , , and so on - an infinite number of potentials.

This is a more epistemic interpretation. As a relation - this could be causation, or a realization, or a grounding relation. For example, the structure of transistors grounds the structure of a circuit. An object cannot be its own reason for existence, because that would imply that it is prior and posterior to itself. Even in an epistemic sense, it would not make any sense to say \" is true because is true\". This means that must be explained by , and must be explained by , and so on ad infinitum. One way to stop this infinite regress is to construct a causal loop, but this leads to circular reasoning, which is, to a certain extent, a type of self explanation. The next logical question is to ask why the infinite chain exists in the first place. This cannot be explained by any constituent elements in the chain, because the chain itself is the object of explanation. It would not make sense to say \"there are fish in the sea because there is a fish in the sea\". One could posit an explanation for the chain, but that would itself be then part of the chain.

If is contingent, then is part of the BCCF, which means is self-explanatory. This cannot be the case, so must be necessary. However, not all conjuctions like the BCCF make sense. Consider the conjuction of all non-self-conjunctive propositions, where a self-conjunctive proposition is one that is conjunctive of itself. is either self-conjunctive or not. If is self-conjunctive, since contains non-self-conjunctive propositions, it is not self-conjunctive. If is not self-conjunctive, since contains all non-self-conjunctive propositions, then contains itself, and is hence self-conjunctive. This presents a major contradiction, and so the BCCF is not necessarily a coherent concept. The BCCF is highly criticized. For instance, this paper by Christopher M. P. Tomaszewski, titled \"The Principle of Sufficient Reason Defended: There Is No Conjunction of All Contingently True Propositions\", completely rejects the idea of a BCCF. The paper refutes Peter van Inwagen's argument that the PSR entails \"modal collapse\", where absolutely everything is necessary. Tomazewski states that a critical flaw in van Inwagen's argument is the assumption that there is a conjuction of all contingently true propositions. He argues that there are too many propositions to conjunct through the use of Cantor's Theorem (directly quoted from the paper): There is a conjunction of all contingently true propositions . For each non-empty collection of propositions which are conjuncts of , there is a unique contingently true proposition to which it corresponds. Every such contingently true proposition is a conjunct of .

(From Cantor's Theorem) There are strictly more propositions which are conjuncts of than there are propositions which are conjuncts of . (2, 3, 4) Therefore, there is no conjunction of all contingently true propositions. The paper also includes a defense of the second premise in the refutation of van Inwagen's argument. Start with a collection of conjuncts of , say , and let be the proposition that is the conjunction of all the conjuncts in . Let be an arbitrary necessary proposition. Then, consider the proposition : Each is a proposition that belongs to this collection. The inclusion of means that is not logicall equivalent to any conjunction of the propositions in , and must hence be included in .

It is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra is used in basically every field of mathematics, from number theory to geometry to topology to logic. Although we have already learned a lot of algebra in school, the algebra we learned is only a small part of the vast field of algebra. The algebra we learned in school is called elementary algebra, and it deals with the basic operations of arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Abstract algebra, on the other hand, is a more advanced form of algebra that deals with more abstract mathematical structures, such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces. These structures are used to study the properties of mathematical objects, such as numbers, vectors, and matrices, in a more general and systematic way. Before we dive into the details of abstract algebra, we need to first establish preliminary concepts and definitions that will be used throughout abstract algebra, such as sets, logic, and proofs.","s":"Abstract Algebra","u":"/notes/maths/Abstract Algebra/Introduction","h":"","p":122},{"i":125,"t":"Given that one problem with the Pruss formulation of the Leibnizian cosmological argument is the use of a general Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), Richard Gale and Alexander Pruss have formulated a cosmological argument that instead relies on a weak PSR.","s":"Gale-Pruss Cosmological Argument","u":"/notes/Arguments for God's Existence/Traditional Arguments/Cosmological Arguments/Gale Pruss CA","h":"","p":124},{"i":127,"t":"For any proposition , if is true, then there is possibly a proposition such that explains .

T: i.e. if it is necessary that , then . 5: i.e. if it is possible that , then it is necessary that it is possible that . Oppy's paper begins with the preliminary definitions for the argument: Def 1: A possible world is a maximal compossible conjunction of abstract propositions. Def 2: The Big Conjunctive Fact—BCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Def 3: The Big Conjunctive Contingent Fact—BCCF—for a possible world is the conjunction of all the contingent propositions that would be true if that world were actual. Some terminology: Compossible means that the propositions can all be true at the same time. Maximal means that there are no other propositions that can be added to the conjunction without making it inconsistent. This means that for any proposition , either or is in the conjunction. Oppy makes a distinction between the weak and strong PSR, noting the primary difference being a proposition \"possibly having an explanation\" or just \"having an explanation\". Then, Oppy writes a paragraph to show that the first premise of the Gale-Pruss argument entails the strong PSR: Suppose that there is a world which is such that the BCF for that world has no explanation in that world. Let the BCF for that world be . Consider the conjunctive proposition: and has no explanation. By hypothesis, this conjunctive proposition is true in . Hence, by W-PSR, there is a world in which this conjunction is true and has an explanation. (Of course, by the rest of the Gale and Pruss proof, this world is none other than itself.) So the conjunctive proposition, that and has no explanation, has an explanation in . But that's absurd. If there is an explanation of why obtains and has no explanation, there there is an explanation of why obtains. Hence both has and lacks an explanation in . Contradiction! So there can be no world which is such that the BCF for lacks an explanation in . What this means is; imagine a proposition that has no explanation in a world . Then, consider the proposition \" is true and has no explanation\". By the weak PSR, this proposition must have an explanation in another world . But this means that has an explanation in .

A personal explanation is one that explains a fact by appealing to the intentions of a person. For instance, to explain why a glass broke, a scientific explanation would involve the laws of physics, while a personal explanation would involve the intentions of a person who broke the glass. Gale and Pruss point out that scientific explanations are generalizations over contingent facts, hence scientific explanations are also contingent and included in the BCCP. Thus the explanation of the BCCP must be a personal explanation, which involves a necessary being. However, this fails to consider one small detail: there are other types of explanations, such as: Metaphysical explanations; one that cites neither intentions nor the evolution of some system or the state of the system at a given time, governed by the laws of nature. For instance, Pruss is an Aristotelian. Aristotelianism posits formal causality, the claim that there are \"forms\" that underlie the existence of things. This form is not a personal agent with intentions causing the various parts to combine, nor is this a scientific explanation. In science, one would not appeal to substantial forms, since it is a metaphysical explanation. Furthermore, it is not governed by \"deterministic or statistical\" laws of nature, and does not deal with some state of affairs. Other examples of metaphysical explanations include the concept of grounding; the structure of DNA is grounded in the laws of chemistry. However, this is not a scientific explanation according to their definition, since it does not involve the state of a system at some time being governed by the laws of nature. Functional realization is another example; things have functions and are realized by certain structures. Part of the reason why something exists is because its constituents realize a certain function. Ethical explanations; these are explanations that involve moral facts. For instance, to explain why violence is wrong, one might appeal to the fact that it causes suffering. This does not cite the intentions of a person or the laws of nature, and is hence not a scientific or personal explanation. Mathematical explanations; these are explanations that involve mathematical facts. For instance, to explain why , one might appeal to the axioms of arithmetic. Additionally, neither the argument nor the paper by Gale and Pruss provide sufficient explanation for the contingency of scientific explanations. Science could rely on necessary truths, such as some fundamental laws of nature, quantum fields, universal wavefunctions, and the like.

You can think of displacement as the distance between the starting and ending points of an object's motion. For example, if you have a car that starts at position and ends at position , the displacement is . Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. It tells us how fast an object is moving and in what direction. Velocity is also a vector quantity, but in one dimension, it can be represented as a scalar.

The law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

This includes topics such as limits, derivatives, and applications of derivatives. After studying differential calculus, students typically study integral calculus, which deals with the accumulation of quantities. This includes topics such as integrals, techniques of integration, and applications of integrals. Finally, students may study multivariable calculus, which extends the concepts of differential and integral calculus to functions of several variables. Calculus 1 and 2 are typically the first two courses in a calculus sequence, and cover the topics of differential and integral calculus, respectively. These courses are typically taken by students in their first or second year of college or university. AP Calculus AB and BC are somewhat equivalent to Calculus 1 and 2, respectively, though there's some differences in the content covered.

Complex Analysis is typically studied after Real Analysis, and deals with the study of complex numbers and functions.

If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\" G. H. Hardy, 1940 The definition for mathematics is not as clear-cut as one might think. As the study of numbers - this is only partially true. Mathematics is not just about numbers, but also about shapes, patterns, and relationships. Many things deal with non-numerical concepts, such as geometry, topology, logic, and set theory. As a deductive science - this is also only partially true. Mathematical reasoning is not just deductive, but also inductive, sometimes even abductive. Many things deal with inductive reasoning, such as statistics, probability, and combinatorics. Rather than being \"pure\" or \"applied\", mathematics is a spectrum of both, and various fields of mathematics can lie anywhere on this spectrum. As the \"science of formal systems\" (Haskell Curry in 1951) - this does not capture the full essence of mathematics. Mathematics is not just about formal systems, but also about intuition, creativity, and discovery. Pure math without intuition is soulless. However, the definitions aside, there are some common themes in mathematics: Mathematics is about abstracting away the unnecessary details and focusing on the essential properties of objects. The first thing you learn, numbers, are abstractions of the real world. The number 1 is not a physical object; you can't say \"give me 1\". Instead, numbers, are abstractions of counting, and they have properties that are useful in various contexts. One advantage of abstraction is that it allows us to study a wide range of objects with similar properties. For instance, the same differential equations that describe the motion of a pendulum can also describe the flow of heat in a metal rod. Mathematics is logical. It is about making precise arguments and drawing conclusions from them. You start with a set of axioms, which are assumed to be true, and then use logical reasoning to derive theorems. The axioms are the starting point, and the theorems are the conclusions. The process of deriving theorems from axioms is called proof. However, mathematics is not just about proving theorems; estimation, approximation, and conjecture are also important. Mathematics is about patterns and structures. It is about recognizing patterns in the world and using them to build structures. For instance, the Fibonacci sequence is a pattern that appears in many natural phenomena, such as the branching of trees and the arrangement of leaves on a stem. The concept of a group is a structure that appears in many areas of mathematics, such as number theory, geometry, and algebra. Generally, mathematics is a logical, abstract, and creative discipline that studies the world in a precise and structured way.","s":"Introduction to Mathematics","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"","p":503},{"i":506,"t":"As previously mentioned, mathematics mixes together intuition and formulation. The intuition is the visual and intuitive interpretation of the concept, while the formulation is the more formal description that shows how the concept can be generalized and computed. The general discovery process for mathematics is; Specific Example → Intuition → Mathematical Model → Wide-Ranging Applications This shows the advantage of abstraction. By abstracting things into their fundamental properties, we can apply the same concepts to a wide range of problems. For instance, when Newton was studying the motion of the planets, he developed the concept of calculus to describe the motion of objects in general. Today, calculus is used everywhere, from physics to economics to computer science to just about every field you can think of. One shortcoming of the modern education system is that it usually does this process in reverse. It starts with the formulation. This is probably partly responsible for the large distaste for mathematics. It's like learning to paint by starting with the chemical composition of paint.","s":"Discovery Process","u":"/notes/maths/intro","h":"#discovery-process","p":503},{"i":508,"t":"Mathematics is a vast field, with many different branches and subfields.

Analysis, which studies the properties of functions and their derivatives and integrals. Geometry, which studies the properties of shapes and spaces. These are just a few of the many branches of mathematics. Each branch has its own set of concepts, techniques, and applications, yet they are all interconnected in some way. Another way to categorize mathematics is by its level of abstraction: Pure mathematics, which studies abstract concepts and structures for their own sake. Applied mathematics, which uses mathematical tools and techniques to solve real-world problems. Pure and applied mathematics are not mutually exclusive; they are two ends of a spectrum. Many areas of mathematics lie somewhere in between, using abstract concepts to solve practical problems. One particular saying I like is that \"pure mathematics explores the world of mathematics, while applied mathematics explores the world with mathematics\".

However, this is just because we drew some lines, not all of them. If we draw a diagonal line, we can see that the transformation twists the line: Start In order to account for all lines in the space, we need to add another condition: that the gridlines remain parallel and evenly spaced. Putting everything together, we can say that: A transformation is linear if it satisfies the following properties when acting on the space: Every line remains a line. The origin remains fixed at .

A non-Cauchy sequence would be something like , where the terms are not getting closer to each other. Cauchy sequences also include vector sequences. In order to formalize a Cauchy sequence, consider this: If terms get closer and closer to each other, you would be able to find two terms in the sequence that are arbitrarily close to each other. So, if you choose any distance, you get to a point in the sequence where all the terms after that point are within that distance of each other.

Cauchy sequences approach a limit. If you have a set , and every Cauchy sequence in converges to a point in , then is called a complete space.

This leads us to the formal definition of a linear subspace: The set is a linear subspace of the vector space if it satisfies the following properties: Closure under Addition: For any vectors and in , the vector is also in .

If the span of forms a linear subspace, then it must satisfy the properties of a linear subspace. We can go through the properties of a linear subspace and check if the span satisfies them: Closure under Addition: If we take any two vectors in the span and add them together, the resulting vector must still be in the span. This is true, since the span contains all possible linear combinations of the vectors. When we add two linear combinations, we simply get another linear combination. Closure under Scalar Multiplication: If we take any vector in the span and multiply it by a scalar, the resulting vector must still be in the span. This is also true, since the span contains all possible linear combinations. When we multiply a linear combination by a scalar, we get another linear combination. Contains the Zero Vector: The span of any set of vectors must contain the zero vector. This is because the zero vector is itself a linear combination of the vectors in the set. Therefore, we can say that: For any set of vectors , the span of forms a linear subspace. This means that we can define a linear subspace simply by specifying a set of vectors that span it. In order for it to not have any redundant vectors, we can choose a set of vectors that are linearly independent. This set of vectors has a special name - it is called a basis for the subspace.

However, we can start by positing these three interpretations of vectors: To a physicist, a vector is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. It can represent something's position, velocity, or some force acting on it. This is the most intuitive interpretation of a vector. These vectors are often represented as arrows in space, where the length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector: To a programmer, a vector is just a list of numbers. It could be used to represent a point in space, but it could also represent other things. For example, very commonly, we can represent a color as a vector. All colors can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, so a color can be represented as a vector with three components. We hence call this vector three-dimensional. Vectors can also be used to represent other things that do not have to do with space. You could have a three-dimensional vector representing a person's age, height, and weight for example. These also apply in scientific studies. For instance, given a chemical reaction, we can represent each reactant and product as a separate component in a vector. In a reaction with 3 reactants and 2 products, we can represent the reaction as a 5-dimensional vector. Another example is in mathematics itself, where we can represent a polynomial as a list of its coefficients. To a mathematician, a vector is a member of a vector space. This is a more abstract definition, but it is the most general. A vector can be anything that has the notion of addition and multiplication defined on it. We will go into detail about this later.

However, note that the starting point of the vector is arbitrary. It can be more helpful to think of the vector as an \"instruction\" to move from the tail to the tip. If you imagine the -axis as east and the -axis as north, then the vector is an instruction to move 2 units east and 1 unit north.

Philosophers like John Locke (1632 - 1704) and Thomas Reid (1710 - 1796) pushed the concept of empiricism which posits that knowledge comes from one's experience. This was in contrast to rationalism, which posited that knowledge comes from reason. In the 19th century, physiological studies began investigating the human sensory systems. German philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 - 1894) measured the speed of nerve impulses and the speed of sound, and eventually, he came to the conclusion that senses are not infallible. This means that the senses can be fooled; that is, there is a psychological reality that is separate from the physical reality. While this was not a new idea, it was a new way of thinking about the senses. Helmholtz's work suggests that despite the fallibility of the senses, we can still use science to measure and understand the mind. This relationship between physical and psychological reality was studied by German researchers like Gustav Fechner (1801 - 1887) and Ernst Weber (1795 - 1878) in what's known as psychophysics. German physician Wilhelm Wundt (1832 - 1920) is often credited with establishing the first psychology laboratory in 1879. He: First strongly promoted the idea of psychology as an experimental science. Provided classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for students to study psychology. (1875) joined the University of Leipzig as a professor, making plans to establish a course in experimental psychology. (1879) established the first laboratory experience - usually considered the birth of psychology as a science. Wundt's work received great responses with students from all over the world coming to study under him. They were trained on various psychological experiments like: Introspection - the process of looking inward to examine one's own thoughts and feelings. Consciousness - the awareness of internal and external stimuli. Mental Chronometry - the study of reaction time. This demonstrates that the mind can be studied scientifically, and that consciousness could be revealed through science.","s":"Prehistory","u":"/notes/psychology/Introduction to Psychology/History of Modern Psychology","h":"#prehistory","p":811},{"i":816,"t":"Wundt's work was brought to the United States by one of his students, Edward Bradford Titchener (1867 - 1927). Titchener was a proponent of structuralism, which is the idea that the mind can be broken down into smaller components. He focused on the adult human mind, but excluded children, animals, and people with mental illnesses from his studies. This \"flavor\" of experimental psychology was popular in the United States, and it was taught in many universities. The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892, but Titchener thought it did not represent experimental psychology well. This led him to found the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1904. This society did not welcome women. However, Titchener's student Margaret Floy Washburn (1871 - 1939) is quite interesting: She was the first doctoral student of Titchener.

Where as Titchener was more reductionist, functionalists were more interested in the function of the mind. James states that consciousness is continuous and always changing, and that it cannot be broken down into smaller components. James wrote the most famous psychology textbook of the time, The Principles of Psychology (1890), and also became a professor at Harvard University. Hall also made significant contributions to psychology, and he founded the first psychology laboratory in the United States at Johns Hopkins University in 1883. He created the first psychology journal in the United States, The American Journal of Psychology, in 1887, andfounded the American Psychological Association in 1892, and he was the first president of the APA. Hall was also deeply interested in child development, he wrote extensively on the subject. Wundt's student, Cattell, was also a functionalist.

Instead of focusing on the internal workings of the mind, behaviorism focuses on observable behavior (e.g. stimuli and responses).

Evolution broadly refers to the gradual change in heritable characteristics within a population over time. Natural selection, on the other hand, is a key mechanism driving evolution. It describes the differential survival and reproductive success of individuals possessing traits that make them better suited to their environment. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that evolution is not synonymous with progress. It is not a linear process culminating in the production of more complex or \"advanced\" organisms. Rather, it is a dynamic, non-directional process, with no inherent goal or endpoint. The evolutionary process is contingent upon the interplay between genetic variation, environmental pressures, and reproductive success. An important concept in evolution is that of a species. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Humans are, for instance, homo sapiens. Over time, species can change. This is called speciation. Speciation is the process by which new species are formed. It occurs when a group of individuals becomes isolated from the rest of the population.

Alterations to the universe's fundamental constants would yield different observers perceiving a correspondingly altered reality. Importantly, terrestrial life has reciprocally shaped the Earth. The initial atmosphere, predominantly composed of carbon dioxide, was transformed by living organisms into its current nitrogen and oxygen-rich state. Oxygen in the atmosphere is almost entirely attributable to photosynthesis: While initial life forms were exclusively anaerobic, the oxygenation of the atmosphere proved toxic, selectively driving the evolution of aerobic organisms - including ourselves, for whom oxygen is now an existential necessity. The universe is not really fine-tuned to life. The vast majority of the universe is inimical to life as we understand it, with only a small fraction potentially habitable. Earth stands as the only place with life. Considering this, assertions of the universe being \"meticulously designed for life\" appear dubious. If such fine-tuning truly existed, wouldn't life be far more common throughout the cosmos?

In the diagram above, the green arrows represent the electric field. The blue arrow represents a test charge. (You need to move the green point a bit for the field to render properly due to a bug.) A test charge is a charge that is so small that it does not affect the electric field. It is used to measure the electric field at a point. Technically, test charges don't exist. However, they are a useful concept for understanding the electric field. Move the blue point around. You would notice that the force on the test charge changes as it moves around. Mathematically, the electric field at a point is given by: Where: is the electric field. is the force on a test charge. is the magnitude of the test charge. hence has units of force per charge, or . As a vector field, the electric field has both magnitude and direction. If the charge is positive, the field points away from the charge.

It allows for the approximation of a non-polynomial function using a polynomial. Polynomials are easy to compute, manipulate, differentiate, and integrate, so approximating a function with a polynomial can make it much easier to work with. To start, consider a function . Assume this is part of some physics problem, and the existence of a term is making the problem difficult to solve. Let's say we are interested in the value of near , and we want to approximate it with a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic function). Denote the quadratic function as . Play around with the sliders below to see how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients a_0, a_1, and a_2: Options Consider how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients , , and . The goal is to find the coefficients that make as close as possible to near . First, consider evaluated at : We want the value of to be the same as at . Hence, one of the coefficients is already determined. Changing the other coefficients will affect the function but will not change the value of . Next, we want the slope of to be the same as the slope of at . This ensures that the value of is close to not only at but also in the neighborhood of ; it doesn't drift too far away from . Now, both the position and the slope of are locked as the same as at . The only thing left is to make sure the concavity of is the same as the concavity of at . Now we have found the coefficients , , and . The quadratic functoin is then: The quadratic function is a good approximation of near . As we add more terms to the polynomial, we can get even closer to the original function. For example, we can add two more terms to get a degree 4 polynomial: The coefficients and can be determined in a similar way as we did for . We take the third and fourth derivatives of at and set them equal to the corresponding derivatives of at . Notice what happens when we take the third derivative of the term in : Notice we are multiplying by by by . This is the same as taking the factorial of : Recall that we want this to be equal to the third derivative of at . Thus: And as such, we can solve for : We get a similar result for : Thus, the degree 4 polynomial approximation of is: Notice that adding the higher degree term does not affect the previous terms. For instance, the concavity of is still the same as the concavity of at . Why? When we take the derivative of a term with a higher power of , the power of decreases by one. The concavity is the second derivative, so the power of decreases by two - so it doesn't become a constant term. Recall that we set . As such, if there is an term in the polynomial, it will be multiplied by zero, and the term will disappear. Hence, each individual coefficient is the \"control\" for a specific order derivative of the function. For a value of near , the polynomial is a good approximation of . Next, consider approximating with a polynomial near some value . Then, the polynomial would be written as: Instead of , we use as the variable, such that the point is treated like . This means that if you plug in , things will cancel. We can keep adding more terms to the polynomial to get a better approximation of near a value of . The derivatives of follow a pattern of at . As such, the coefficients of the polynomial will follow a similar pattern: Next, we can generalize this to any function : And to any value : We have just derived the Taylor series for any function centered at .

Since the patch is an area, it scales as the square of the distance from the origin. Therefore: This is not quite right, as the area also changes based on how you tilt . Using the shadow analogy, if you tilt , the shadow could be elongated or squished.

One way to conceptualize this is just based on scaling. If you, once again, think of the point charge as a light source, if it emits light rays at steady rates, as the distance increases, the flux would decrease by an inverse square law, but the area would increase by the square of the distance, meaning they cancel out.

The curve in the visual I used quite a complex curve in the visual above: It's actually quite difficult to create a curve like this, because it needs to satisfy a few conditions: It must start at a given point and end at a given point.

The force we are considering is gravity (ignore forces from the wind, just note that it affects the box's motion).

Consider the following vector field: Start In this case, the water is flowing out of the region. In this case, the divergence is positive. Note that a positive divergence doesn't mean that all the water is flowing out of the region. It just means that more water is flowing out than in. For example, the divergence here is also positive: Start Regions where the divergence is positive are called sources. In the water example, the source could be from a fountain. Next, consider the following vector field: Start We flipped the vector field, so now the water is flowing into the region, and the divergence is negative. Regions where the divergence is negative are called sinks. In the water example, the sink could be a drain. Of course, this is not how water works in real life. Going back to the first example: Start Notice that at any region, there's no net flow of water. The water is flowing out of the region as much as it is flowing into the region. Water is incompressible, and the mathematical term for this is that the divergence of the vector field is zero.","s":"Intuitition for Divergence","u":"/notes/maths/Calculus 3/Extending the Derivative Part 2","h":"#intuitition-for-divergence","p":1224},{"i":1232,"t":"The notation for divergence we will currently use is (although this is not the only notation).

Meaning, it increases as we move to the right. This can be written as: The second scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the right, and some water flowing in from the left. Recall that the divergence is still positive: Notice that the slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. The last scenario is where there is a lot of water flowing out into the left, and some water flowing in from the right. The slope of the graph is still positive, as it increases as we move to the right. In this case, it's very negative at the left, and at the right, it is still negative, but less so. Hence, It should be clear from these scenarios that: Hence, the partial derivative is somehow related to the divergence. We can apply the same logic for the component of the vector field: In this case, the water will only flow vertically.

Conventionally a positive rotation is counterclockwise. Notice how, just with one number, we can describe 2D rotation in its entirety. In 3D space, rotation is more complex: First we need to consider the axis of rotation. This is where the rotation occurs about. Next, we need to consider the magnitude and direction of the rotation - which is a vector. This is known as the angular velocity, denoted .

Consider \"copying\" this vector for every value: Of course, only some of the vectors are visible. In reality, for every value, there is a plane in which the vector field exists.

This should also make sense intuitively; a zero second derivative means that the slope is constant throughout the function, so the function should never curve. Consider the following scalar field: With a constant value, the function is simply an exponential, and with a nonconstant value, the function is an exponential that sort of oscillates. Consider the Laplacion of this scalar field: If we plot the scalar field , it doesn't look like a straight line, but it is a harmonic function: To show why this is harmonic, consider the single-variable case again: In a point where , the function is concave up. This means that the points around it are higher than the point itself. Even in a situation where the function has a positive slope: While there are points that are lower than the point itself, on average, the points around it are higher. Next, generalize this to a scalar field. If the Laplacian is nonzero, then it means that around the point, its neighbors are higher/lower than the point itself on average: If the Laplacian is positive (), then the neighbors are higher than the point itself on average. If the Laplacian is negative (), then the neighbors are lower than the point itself on average. The function we have is harmonic; the Laplacian is zero. This means that on average, the point's neighbors are at the same height as the point itself. Laplacians come up in many areas of physics, and this concept of the neighbors' height does have physical significance. For example, if you were considering heat flow, then you would consider the heat around the point to evaluate how the heat is distributed.

In the future, we will see that treating the derivative as a fraction is very beneficial in many cases, like implicit differentiation, related rates, substitution, separation of variables, and more. However, this notion of the derivative as a fraction is not entirely accurate. In modern mathematics, calculus is built on Analysis, which is the rigorous study of limits and continuity. The derivative, as we've shown, is defined as a limit, not a fraction. The concept of an infinitesimal also fell out of favor due to its lack of rigor, and is replaced by the Epsilon-Delta definition of limits (except in non-standard analysis and smooth infinitesimal analysis). When we manipulate them like fractions, what we're really doing \"under the hood\" is applying the rules of differentiation, like its linearity, chain rule, and product rule.

Predator Growth → Prey Decline - The more foxes there are, the more rabbits they eat, so the rabbit population decreases. Prey Decline → Predator Decline - The less rabbits there are, the less food there is for the foxes, so the fox population decreases.

First, consider the numerator: This is equivalent to a certain cross product. The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors and is . Hence: Isn't the cross product a 3D operation? The cross product is indeed a 3D operation, meaning it's only defined for vectors . However, the cross product can be generalized to 2D vectors by considering them as 3D vectors with a -component of 0. Hence, the proper way to write the cross product is: Instead of considering the cross product itself, which has a direction in 3D space, we consider the magnitude of the cross product, which is a scalar, and makes sense in 2D space. We can consider what both and represent visually. Consider a curve of some parametric equation , and consider points on the curve: For every point on the curve, consider a vector pointing there. Then, the first derivative measures the movement in this vector. If you were to do this for all points, then you get the tangent vector. To visualize , consider plotting the tangent vectors separately, placed at the origin. Then, consider the change in these tangent vectors. In essence, the first derivative measures the change in the tip of the vector function, while the second derivative measures the change in the tangent vector. Consider the cross product of these two vectors. To illustrate what it means, consider tangent vectors on a curve with high curvature: Notice how it's almost a rotation as approaches 0. Hence, the acceleration of the tangent vector would approximately be perpendicular to the tangent vector. In other words, the curvature is essentially how perpendicular the acceleration is to the tangent vector. This should make you instantly think of the cross product, which is exactly what the curvature formula is. Recall that geometrically, the magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. As such, if they're more perpendicular, the area is larger, and hence the curvature is higher, which is exactly what the formula evaluates. So, the curvature can be described as: There's a problem, however. Recall that the curvature is defined as the rate of change with respect to arc length, since the curvature is a property of the curve itself, not the parameterization. This would pose a problem to our makeshift formulation of the curvature, since a higher speed would imply a longer tangent vector, which would imply a higher curvature. For instance, if you double the speed, the tangent vector would double in length, and so will the acceleration. We can instead consider \"shrinking\" the tangent vector to a unit vector: However, for the acceleration vector, we divide by the magnitude of the velocity vector, so that it corresponds to the tangent: Recall that the second derivative tells you how much the tangent vector changes, and the first derivative tells you how much the curve changes. If we want to express everything in terms of the tangent vector, we should divide by the magnitude of the tangent vector. Then the cross product of these two vectors is: This is actually equivalent to the derivative of the unit tangent vector with respect to time.

However, it can be visualized in by mapping inputs in a 2D plane to outputs in a 3D space. This results in a surface in 3D space. One common way to make this more convenient is to, instead of using a separate 2D plane, \"override\" the 2D plane into the -plane in 3D space. Start Here, we start with a 2D plane in the -plane, and then transform each point to the output of the function. This is visualized by moving the input plane to form the surface. Next, consider one singular point on the surface, say . This point is visualized by seeing how a point on the input plane is transformed in the output surface. We can evaluate the output of the function at this point: Start Next, recall the partial derivative with respect to : Since the partial derivative with respect to means keeping constant, we can think of a line in the input plane where is constant: Start This visualization gives an idea of how the output of the function changes as changes, while keeping constant. The entire line is essentially a line where is unchanged, whereas varies along the line. For a different constant, you would get a different curve along the surface. For the partial derivative, we visualize it by incrementing by a small amount, and seeing how the output changes.

Additionally, notice how, both in the original and transformed spaces, the line segments are still connected at the endpoints, and the endpoints are the transformed vectors. This means that to create the new set of line segments, we only need to transform the endpoints of the original line segments. Next, let's prove this mathematically. First, apply the transformation to . Using the additivity of linear transformations: Then, using the homogeneity of linear transformations: And using the additivity again: This is known as the image of the line segment under the transformation . Similarly, we can find the image of and under the transformation : Notice what we've done here - we have a set of infinite vectors that span some line segment. Instead of applying the transformation to every single one of these vectors (which is impossible), we've applied the transformation just to the endpoints of the line segment and then used the linearity of the transformation to find the transformation of the entire line segment. This reflects a powerful property of linear transformations which we have already shown many times - you don't need to know how it affects every single vector in the space.","s":"Linear Transformations of Subsets","u":"/notes/maths/Linear Algebra/Linear Transformations","h":"#linear-transformations-of-subsets","p":1672},{"i":1705,"t":"We've seen how linear transformations affect individual vectors and subsets of vectors.

The coefficient matrix is the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in the system of equations: The coefficient matrix is: We can augment the coefficient matrix with the right-hand side of the equations: It might not be immediately clear why we're doing this - we could've just solved the equations directly. One reason is that it just saves time; we won't have to write , , , and every time. We can apply the same operations to the augmented matrix as we would to the system of equations. For example, we can add a multiple of one row to another, or swap two rows. The leading entry in a row is the first non-zero element in the row. We want to make all leading entries 1, and all other entries in the column 0. Additionally, for every row with a leading 1, all other entries in the column should be 0. For example, this is a matrix that satisfies the conditions: This is called the reduced row-echelon form (RREF) of the matrix. The RREF of a matrix is denoted as . Recall our augmented matrix: We can perform operations on the matrix to get it into RREF. Denote row 1 as , row 2 as , and row 3 as for simplicity. We will iterate through every column to get the matrix into RREF. First, notice that already has a leading 1. Hence, we want to make all other entries in the column 0. This sets the first column in to 0. Next, to set the first column in to 0, we can subtract from : Now, the first column is in RREF. has a leading , so we want to make that instead.

Replace with : Recall the criteria for RREF: The leading entry in each row is 1. The leading 1 in each row is the only non-zero entry in its column. Our matrix now satisfies these conditions: Some more terminology to note for this matrix: Each leading 1, as the only non-zero entry in its column, is called a pivot entry. The row with all zero entries is known as the zeroed-out row. By convention, in RREF, the zeroed-out row is at the bottom of the matrix. The process we have just done to achieve RREF is called Gaussian elimination. To illustrate how this actually helps us solve the system of equations, let's rewrite the matrix in terms of the variables: The variables associated with the pivot entries are known as pivot variables. In our case, the pivot variables are and . The others are called free variables. Recall that our system of equations had four unknowns, but only three equations, meaning we can't derive exact values for all variables. The free variables are the ones that can take on any value.
