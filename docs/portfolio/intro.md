# Welcome

I am 0Tick, and this is my portfolio. You can scroll through the sidebar to view my projects, or you can read on to learn more about me.

## Hobbies

### Programming

I have been programming since around 2019, and I have been learning ever since. I have learned many languages and technologies, including:

* HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end
* TypeScript, React, and Next.js (this website is built with Docusaurus)
* Python and Lua for scripting
* Java and Kotlin for Minecraft stuff
* DenizenScript and MythicMobs for Minecraft server scripting
* Rust, because it's a nice language
* C, because every programmer should know C

Footnote: I don't guarantee that I'm good at all of these, just that I know them and have used them.

### Gaming

I play a few games, including [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com).

### Music

I listen to a lot of music, and I play the piano. I've just passed the ATCL piano exam, and I'm currently working on the LTCL exam.
My favorite pieces include Chopin's Ballade No. 4, Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, and Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

I also compose music on MuseScore and Logic Pro X. I currently have no published works.

### Other

* I used to play chess, but I stopped after I got bored of it.
* Occassionally I learn a few magic tricks.
