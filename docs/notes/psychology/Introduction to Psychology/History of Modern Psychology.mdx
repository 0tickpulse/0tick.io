# History of Modern Psychology

The history of psychology is difficult to define, especially considering the origin of psychology.
Some start the history of psychology with the ancient Greeks, while others start with the 19th century, where psychology was formally established as a discipline.
Taking the mid 19th century as the starting point, we can examine the history of psychology in primarily American contexts.
This shall be referred to as modern psychology.

## Prehistory

American psychology has its roots in philosophy and physiology.
Philosophers like **John Locke** (1632 - 1704) and **Thomas Reid** (1710 - 1796) pushed the concept of **empiricism** which posits that knowledge comes from one's experience.
This was in contrast to **rationalism**, which posited that knowledge comes from reason.

In the 19th century, physiological studies began investigating the human sensory systems.
German philosopher **Hermann von Helmholtz** (1821 - 1894) measured the speed of nerve impulses and the speed of sound, and eventually, he came to the conclusion that senses are not infallible.

This means that the senses can be fooled; that is, there is a psychological reality that is separate from the physical reality.
While this was not a new idea, it was a new way of thinking about the senses.
Helmholtz's work suggests that despite the fallibility of the senses, we can still use science to measure and understand the mind.

This relationship between physical and psychological reality was studied by German researchers like **Gustav Fechner** (1801 - 1887) and **Ernst Weber** (1795 - 1878) in what's known as **psychophysics**.

German physician **Wilhelm Wundt** (1832 - 1920) is often credited with establishing the first psychology laboratory in 1879. He:

- First strongly promoted the idea of psychology as an experimental science.
- Provided classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for students to study psychology.
- (1875) joined the University of Leipzig as a professor, making plans to establish a course in experimental psychology.
- (1879) established the first laboratory experience - usually considered the birth of psychology as a science.

Wundt's work received great responses with students from all over the world coming to study under him.
They were trained on various psychological experiments like:

- **Introspection** - the process of looking inward to examine one's own thoughts and feelings.
- **Consciousness** - the awareness of internal and external stimuli.
- **Mental Chronometry** - the study of reaction time.

This demonstrates that the mind can be studied scientifically, and that consciousness could be revealed through science.

## The United States: Structuralism

Wundt's work was brought to the United States by one of his students, **Edward Bradford Titchener** (1867 - 1927).
Titchener was a proponent of **structuralism**, which is the idea that the mind can be broken down into smaller components.
He focused on the adult human mind, but excluded children, animals, and people with mental illnesses from his studies.

This "flavor" of experimental psychology was popular in the United States, and it was taught in many universities.
The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded in 1892, but Titchener thought it did not represent experimental psychology well.
This led him to found the **Society of Experimental Psychologists** in 1904.

This society did not welcome women. However, Titchener's student **Margaret Floy Washburn** (1871 - 1939) is quite interesting:

- She was the first doctoral student of Titchener.
- In 1894, she became the first Psychology PhD in the United States.
- In 1921, she became the second woman to be elected president of the APA.

## Functionalism, A New Approach

Structural psychology was not the only approach to psychology in the United States.
Some other people in America, like **William James** (1842 - 1910), **Stanley Hall** (1844 - 1924), and **James McKeen Cattell** (1860 - 1944), were interested in **functionalism**.

Where as Titchener was more reductionist, functionalists were more interested in the function of the mind.
James states that consciousness is continuous and always changing, and that it cannot be broken down into smaller components.

James wrote the most famous psychology textbook of the time, *The Principles of Psychology* (1890), and also became a professor at Harvard University.

Hall also made significant contributions to psychology, and he founded the first psychology laboratory in the United States at Johns Hopkins University in 1883.
He created the first psychology journal in the United States, *The American Journal of Psychology*, in 1887, andfounded the American Psychological Association in 1892, and he was the first president of the APA.

Hall was also deeply interested in child development, he wrote extensively on the subject.

Wundt's student, Cattell, was also a functionalist.
He believed, like Galton (a cousin of Darwin), that society should be improved through selective breeding, a form of **eugenics**.
He also created a department of psychology at Columbia University.

## Growth of Psychology and Behaviorism

In the early 20th century, psychology grew rapidly in America.
The number of psychology departments in universities increased, and the number of students studying psychology also increased.

John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner, and many others advocated for a new approach to psychology called **behaviorism**.
Instead of focusing on the internal workings of the mind, behaviorism focuses on observable behavior (e.g. stimuli and responses).

While behaviorism was very popular, by the 1960s, it was being challenged for its neglect of mental processes leading to a failure to explain complex human behavior.
