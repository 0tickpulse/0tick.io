Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior.
It aims to understand how people think, feel, and act, both individually and in groups.

## Interdisciplinary Nature of Psychology


Psychology is an interdisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from various disciplines, including:

- **Biology**: Understanding the biological basis of behavior, such as the role of the brain, hormones, and genetics.
- **Neuroscience**: Investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior, such as brain imaging and neurochemistry.
- **Philosophy**: Addressing fundamental questions about the nature of the mind, consciousness, and free will.
- **Sociology**: Examining how social factors influence behavior, such as culture, social norms, and socialization.
- **Anthropology**: Studying how human behavior has evolved over time and varies across different cultures.
