# Tensor Formulation of Electromagnetism

In the previous section, we briefly reviewed electromagnetic theory and Maxwell's equations.
In this section and the subsequent sections, we will explore a few different formulations of electromagnetism, which will help us understand the underlying structure of electromagnetism.
The first formulation we will explore is the tensor formulation, which is particularly useful in the context of special relativity, as it makes relativistic invariance extremely clear.

## Introduction

Fundamentally, in a formulation of electromagnetism, we demand that the formulation provides:

1. A way to describe the electric and magnetic fields.
2. A way to describe how these fields interact with charged particles.
3. A way to describe how these fields evolve in time and space.

In the vector calculus formulation, we answer these questions as follows:

1. The electric field $\vb{E}$ and magnetic field $\vb{B}$ are described as vector fields.
2. The interaction of these fields with charged particles is described by the Lorentz force law, $\vb{F} = q(\vb{E} + \vb{v} \times \vb{B})$.
3. The evolution of these fields is described by Maxwell's equations, which are, here, a set of four partial differential equations.

However, this formulation is not particularly elegant, and it does not make the underlying structure of electromagnetism clear.
The Lorentz invariance of Maxwell's equations is not immediately apparent, and the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields is not as clear as it could be.
To address these issues, we can reformulate Maxwell's equations in a more elegant way using tensors and 4-vectors.

From the previous section we know that there are a few quantities that are useful in describing the electromagnetic field:

- The electric field $\vb{E}$, which describes the force per unit charge on a charged particle.
- The magnetic field $\vb{B}$, which describes the force per unit charge on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field.
- The scalar potential $\phi$, which is related to the electric field.
- The vector potential $\vb{a}$, which is related to the magnetic field.

In relativistic physics, we often unify different quantities into a single mathematical object to simplify the equations and make the relationships between them clearer.
For example, energy and momentum are unified into a single 4-momentum vector, which leads to a more elegant formulation of the laws of motion in special relativity.
Likewise, we can unify the scalar and vector potentials into a single mathematical object known as the 4-potential $A^\mu$:

$$
\begin{equation}
A^\mu := \mqty[\phi/c \\ \vb{a}] = \mqty[\frac{\phi}{c} \\ a^x \\ a^y \\ a^z]. \label{eq:4-potential-def}
\end{equation}
$$

As a 4-vector, it obeys the transformation rule

$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{A}^\mu = \Lambda^\mu_{\ \nu} A^\nu,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\Lambda^\mu_{\ \nu} \in \mathrm{SO}(1, 3)$ is a Lorentz transformation matrix.
This means that the 4-potential transforms in the same way as any other 4-vector under Lorentz transformations.

The dual of the 4-potential, denoted as $A_\mu$, is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
A_\mu := \eta_{\mu\nu} A^\nu = \mqty[\phi/c & -a^x & -a^y & -a^z],
\end{equation}
$$

where $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric tensor, which is used to lower indices of 4-vectors.

### 4-Current

Another important quantity in electromagnetism is the 4-current $J^\mu$, which describes the flow of electric charge and current in spacetime.
The charge density $\rho$ is the amount of charge per unit volume, and the current density $\vb{j}$ is the flow of charge per unit area per unit time.
In other words, we can consider $\rho$ as a spatial density of charge, and $\vb{j}$ as a temporal density of charge.
This motivates a unified description of charge and current in spacetime, leading to the definition of the 4-current:

$$
\begin{equation}
J^\mu := \mqty[c \rho \\ \vb{j}] = \mqty[c \rho \\ j^x \\ j^y \\ j^z]. \label{eq:4-current-def}
\end{equation}
$$

## Faraday Tensor

Next, consider the electric and magnetic fields in terms of the 4-potential.
First, recall that the two fields are related to the potentials by

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{E} &= -\nabla \phi - \pdv{\vb{a}}{t}, \\
\vb{B} &= \nabla \times \vb{a}.
\end{align}
$$

To write this more explicitly, we can consider the individual components of the electric and magnetic fields.
First, we know that $\phi$ is just $cA_t$, and the vector potential $\vb{a}$ has components $-A_x$, $-A_y$, and $-A_z$.
Then, electric field components can be expressed as

$$
\begin{align}
E^x &= -\partial_x cA_t + \partial_t A_x, \\
E^y &= -\partial_y cA_t + \partial_t A_y, \\
E^z &= -\partial_z cA_t + \partial_t A_z.
\end{align}
$$

Dividing by $c$, we can rewrite these as

$$
\begin{align}
E^x/c &= \partial_{ct} A_x - \partial_x A_t, \\
E^y/c &= \partial_{ct} A_y - \partial_y A_t, \\
E^z/c &= \partial_{ct} A_z - \partial_z A_t.
\end{align}
$$

Similarly, the magnetic field components are given by

$$
\begin{align}
B^x &= \partial_y A_z - \partial_z A_y, \\
B^y &= \partial_z A_x - \partial_x A_z, \\
B^z &= \partial_x A_y - \partial_y A_x.
\end{align}
$$

Notice that all six components of the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of the 4-potential $A^\mu$ and its derivatives.
Notably, they all involve the format $\partial_\nu A^\mu - \partial_\mu A^\nu$.
This suggests that we can define a single mathematical object that encapsulates both the electric and magnetic fields.
We can define a quantity $F_{\mu\nu}$, as

$$
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu\nu} := \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu, \label{eq:faraday-tensor-def}
\end{equation}
$$

known as the **Faraday tensor** or **electromagnetic field tensor**.
It is clear that this tensor is antisymmetric;

$$
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu = -(\partial_\nu A_\mu - \partial_\mu A_\nu) = -F_{\nu\mu}.
\end{equation}
$$

The components of the Faraday tensor can be expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic fields as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[0 & E_x/c & E_y/c & E_z/c \\ -E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\ -E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\ -E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0].
\end{equation}
$$

As a (0, 2) tensor, it transforms under Lorentz transformations as

$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} = \Lambda^\alpha_{\ \mu} \Lambda^\beta_{\ \nu} F_{\alpha\beta},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\Lambda^\alpha_{\ \mu}$ is the Lorentz transformation matrix.

The contravariant form of the Faraday tensor, denoted as $F^{\mu\nu}$, is obtained by raising the indices using the Minkowski metric:

$$
\begin{equation}
F^{\mu\nu} = \eta^{\mu\alpha} \eta^{\nu\beta} F_{\alpha\beta},
\end{equation}
$$

which can be evaluated as

$$
\begin{equation}
F^{\mu\nu} = \mqty[0 & -E_x/c & -E_y/c & -E_z/c \\ E_x/c & 0 & B_z & -B_y \\ E_y/c & -B_z & 0 & B_x \\ E_z/c & B_y & -B_x & 0].
\end{equation}
$$

The components of the electric and magnetic fields can be extracted from the Faraday tensor as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
E^i &= -cF^{0i}, \\
B^i &= \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon^{ijk} F_{jk}, \\
B_i &= -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{ijk} F^{jk},
\end{align}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol, which is used to express the cross product in a more compact form.

The **dual tensor** $G^{\mu\nu}$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
G^{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} F_{\alpha\beta}. \label{eq:dual-tensor-def}
\end{equation}
$$

It is the Hodge dual of the Faraday tensor and is useful in expressing the homogeneous Maxwell's equations.
(If you are not familiar with the Hodge dual, it is a mathematical operation that takes a differential form and produces another differential form of the same degree, but in a different orientation.
No need to worry about this for now, as we will not use it in this section.)
Its matrix form is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
G^{\mu\nu} = \mqty[0 & -B_x & -B_y & -B_z \\ B_x & 0 & E_z/c & -E_y/c \\ B_y & -E_z/c & 0 & E_x/c \\ B_z & E_y/c & -E_x/c & 0].
\end{equation}
$$

Then, the components of the electric and magnetic fields can be extracted from the dual tensor as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
B^i &= -G^{0i}, \\
E^i &= -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon^{ijk} G_{jk}, \\
E_i &= -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{ijk} G^{jk}.
\end{align}
$$

One can see that in the dual tensor, the roles of the electric and magnetic fields are "swapped" compared to the Faraday tensor.

### Continuity Equation in Tensor Form

In the context of electromagnetism, the conservation of charge is expressed through the continuity equation.
In the vector calculus formulation, the continuity equation is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div{\vb{j}} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

As previously stated, $\rho$ and $\vb{j}$ are parts of the 4-current $J^\mu$.
As such, $\partial_t \rho$ is just $\partial_{ct} J^t$, and $\div{\vb{j}}$ is just $\partial_i J^i$.
Thus, we can rewrite the continuity equation as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_{ct} J^t + \partial_i J^i = \partial_\mu J^\mu = 0. \label{eq:continuity-equation-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

Recall that this is just the 4-divergence of the 4-current $J^\mu$.
As you can see, tensor notation allows us to express the continuity equation in a more compact and elegant form.

## Maxwell's Equations in Tensor Form

Finally, we can express Maxwell's equations in tensor form.

We can classify Maxwell's equations into homogeneous and inhomogeneous equations.
A homogeneous differential equation is one whose terms all involve the function being solved for, while an inhomogeneous differential equation has terms that do not involve the function being solved for.
For example, the equation $f''(x) = 0$ is a homogeneous differential equation, while the equation $f''(x) = x$ is an inhomogeneous differential equation.

Gauss's law, $\div{\vb{E}} = \rho/\epsilon_0$, and the Ampère-Maxwell law, $\curl{\vb{B}} = \mu_0 \vb{j} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial_t \vb{E}$, are inhomogeneous equations.
The other two equations, Faraday's law of induction, $\curl{\vb{E}} = -\partial_t \vb{B}$, and Gauss's law for magnetism, $\div{\vb{B}} = 0$, are homogeneous equations.
We can express both homogeneous equations as one tensor equation, and likewise for the inhomogeneous equations.

First, notice that the divergence of the electric field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
\div{\vb{E}} = \pdv{E^x}{x} + \pdv{E^y}{y} + \pdv{E^z}{z} = \partial_i E^i.
\end{equation}
$$

Since the electric field is related to the Faraday tensor by $E^i = cF^{it}$ (we can see this by looking at the components of the Faraday tensor), we can rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\div{\vb{E}} = \partial_i E^i = c\partial_\mu F^{\mu t}.
\end{equation}
$$

We can switch from the spatial index $i$ to the temporal index $\mu$ because the $0$th component of the Faraday tensor is zero, so it does not contribute to the divergence.

The curl of the magnetic field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
(\curl{\vb{B}})_i = -\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j B_k,
\end{equation}
$$

where we have just used the formula for a cross product but plugged in $\nabla$ for one of the vectors.
Next, plugging in $B_k = -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{kmn} F^{mn}$, we can rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
(\curl{\vb{B}})_i = -\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j \qty(-\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{kmn} F^{mn}) = -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon^{ijk} \varepsilon_{kmn} \partial_j F^{mn}.
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we can use the identity

$$
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon^{ijk} \varepsilon_{kmn} = \delta^i_m \delta^j_n - \delta^i_n \delta^j_m
\end{equation}
$$

to rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\curl{\vb{B}})_i &= -\frac{1}{2} (\delta^i_m \delta^j_n - \delta^i_n \delta^j_m) \partial_j F^{mn} = -\frac{1}{2} (\partial_j F^{ij} - \partial_j F^{ji}) \\
&= -\frac{1}{2} (\partial_j F^{ij} + \partial_i F^{ij}) = -\partial_j F^{ij} = \partial_i F^{ji}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The time derivative of the electric field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_t E^k = \partial_{ct} c E^k = \partial_{ct} c(-cF^{tk}) = -c^2 \partial_{ct} F^{tk}.
\end{equation}
$$

To put these together, we summarize the substitutions that we have made so far:

- $\div{\vb{E}} = c\partial_\mu F^{\mu t}$
- $(\curl{\vb{B}})_i = \partial_i F^{ji}$
- $\partial_t E^k = -c^2 \partial_{ct} F^{tk}$
- $\rho = \frac{J^t}{c}$ (from the definition of the 4-current)
- $\vb{j} = J^i$ (the spatial components of the 4-current)

Gauss's law becomes

$$
\begin{align}
\div{\vb{E}} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\implies c\partial_\mu F^{\mu t} &= \frac{1}{c\epsilon_0} J^t.
\end{align}
$$

We can divide both sides by $c$ to get

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu t} = \frac{1}{c^2 \epsilon_0} J^t.
\end{equation}
$$

And since $c^2 = \frac{1}{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}$, we can rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu t} = \mu_0 J^t. \label{eq:gauss-law-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

Similarly, the Ampère-Maxwell law becomes

$$
\begin{align}
\curl{\vb{B}} &= \mu_0 \vb{j} + \frac{1}{c^2} \partial_t \vb{E} \\
\implies \partial_i F^{ji} &= \mu_0 J^j + \frac{1}{c^2} (-c^2 \partial_{ct} F^{tj}) \nonumber \\
&= \mu_0 J^j - \partial_{ct} F^{tj}.
\end{align}
$$

Placing $\partial_{ct} F^{tj}$ on the left-hand side, we get

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_i F^{ji} + \partial_{ct} F^{tj} = \mu_0 J^j.
\end{equation}
$$

Then, relabeling $j$ to $i$ in the $\partial_{ct} F^{tj}$ term, we get

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_i F^{ji} + \partial_{ct} F^{ti} = \mu_0 J^i.
\end{equation}
$$

We can merge the two terms on the left into a single term, as $i$ and $ct$ are spatial and temporal indices, respectively.
They combine to a single $\mu$ index;

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu i} = \mu_0 J^i. \label{eq:ampere-maxwell-law-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, we can combine Equations $\eqref{eq:gauss-law-tensor}$ and $\eqref{eq:ampere-maxwell-law-tensor}$.
The former describes the derivatives of $F^{\mu t}$, while the latter describes the derivatives of $F^{\mu i}$.
The $t$ and $i$ indices are once again spatial and temporal indices, respectively, so we can combine them into a single $\nu$ index.
Thus, we can write the two equations as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} = \mu_0 J^\nu. \label{eq:maxwell-equations-inhomogeneous-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

---

Next, consider the homogeneous equations—Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction.
By homogeneous, we mean that the equations do not have any source terms, or terms that do not involve the electromagnetic field.

Just like before, we will replace all the terms in the equations with their tensor equivalents.
This time, however, we will be leveraging the dual tensor $G^{\mu\nu}$.
This is because the roles of the electric and magnetic fields are "swapped" in this derivation as compared to the previous one.
As such, using the dual tensor allows the derivation to stay consistent with the structure of the equations.

The divergence of the magnetic field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
\div{\vb{B}} = \pdv{B^x}{x} + \pdv{B^y}{y} + \pdv{B^z}{z} = \partial_i B^i.
\end{equation}
$$

Then, using $B^i = -G^{0i}$, we can rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\div{\vb{B}} = \partial_i B^i = -\partial_\mu G^{\mu t}.
\end{equation}
$$

Given that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (from Gauss's law for magnetism), we can write this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu G^{\mu t} = 0. \label{eq:gauss-law-magnetism-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we will express Faraday's law in terms of the dual tensor.
The curl of the electric field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\curl{\vb{E}})_i &= -\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j E_k = -\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j \qty(-cG^{tk}) = c\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j G^{tk} \\
&= c\varepsilon^{ijk} \partial_j \qty(\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{kmn} G^{mn}) = \frac{c}{2} \varepsilon^{ijk} \varepsilon_{kmn} \partial_j G^{mn} \\
&= \frac{c}{2} (\delta^i_m \delta^j_n - \delta^i_n \delta^j_m) \partial_j G^{mn} = \frac{c}{2} (\partial_j G^{ij} - \partial_j G^{ji}) \\
&= \frac{c}{2} (\partial_j G^{ij} + \partial_i G^{ij}) = \frac{c}{2} \partial_j G^{ij} = c\partial_j G^{ji}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The time derivative of the magnetic field can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_t B^k = \partial_{ct} c B^k = \partial_{ct} c(-G^{tk}) = -c^2 \partial_{ct} G^{tk}.
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore, Faraday's law becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \vb{B} = -c \curl{\vb{E}} \implies -c^2 \partial_{ct} G^{tk} = -c \partial_j G^{jk}
\end{equation}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_{ct} G^{tk} + \partial_j G^{jk} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

As $ct$ and $j$ are spatial and temporal indices, respectively, we can combine them into a single $\mu$ index;

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu G^{\mu k} = 0. \label{eq:faraday-law-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

Once again, we can combine Equations $\eqref{eq:gauss-law-magnetism-tensor}$ and $\eqref{eq:faraday-law-tensor}$.
The former describes the derivatives of $G^{\mu t}$, while the latter describes the derivatives of $G^{\mu i}$.
The $t$ and $i$ indices are once again spatial and temporal indices, respectively, so we can combine them into a single $\nu$ index.
Thus, we can write the two equations as

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu G^{\mu \nu} = 0. \label{eq:maxwell-equations-homogeneous-tensor}
\end{equation}
$$

## Summary and Next Steps

Thus we have fully expressed electromagnetism in terms of tensors.

<Boxed>

**Maxwell's Equations in Tensor Formulation**: The inhomogeneous and homogeneous Maxwell's equations can be expressed in tensor notation as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} &= \mu_0 J^\nu, \tag{\ref{eq:maxwell-equations-inhomogeneous-tensor}} \\
\partial_\mu G^{\mu \nu} &= 0, \tag{\ref{eq:maxwell-equations-homogeneous-tensor}}
\end{align}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{align}
F^{\mu \nu} &:= \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu, \tag{\ref{eq:faraday-tensor-def}} \\
G^{\mu \nu} &:= \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\alpha \beta}, \tag{\ref{eq:dual-tensor-def}} \\
J^\mu &:= \mqty[c \rho \\ \vb{j}] = \mqty[c \rho \\ j^x \\ j^y \\ j^z], \tag{\ref{eq:4-current-def}} \\
A^\mu &:= \mqty[\phi/c \\ \vb{a}] = \mqty[\frac{\phi}{c} \\ a^x \\ a^y \\ a^z], \tag{\ref{eq:4-potential-def}} \\
\eta_{\mu \nu} &:= \mqty[1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1].
\end{align}
$$

The conservation of charge is expressed through the continuity equation

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu J^\mu = 0. \tag{\ref{eq:continuity-equation-tensor}}
\end{equation}
$$

</Boxed>

In this section, we have reformulated Maxwell's equations in a more elegant way using tensors and 4-vectors.
This formulation makes the underlying structure of electromagnetism clearer and highlights the Lorentz invariance of the equations.
In the next section, we will explore the Clifford algebra formulation of Maxwell's equations, which provides an alternative perspective on electromagnetism.
