# Clifford Algebra Formulation of Electromagnetism

Previously, we discussed both the vector calculus and tensor calculus formulations of electromagnetism.
In this section, we will explore the [Clifford algebra](../../Part%20II%20Special%20Relativity/Spacetime%20Geometry/Introduction%20to%20Clifford%20Algebras) formulation of electromagnetism, which provides a more geometric approach to the subject.

## Electromagnetic Field in Cl(3, 0)

In the vector calculus formulation, we represent the electromagnetic field using two vector fields: the electric field $\vb{E}$ and the magnetic field $\vb{B}$.
In the tensor calculus formulation, we represent the electromagnetic field using the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$, which is an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor.
In the Clifford algebra formulation, we can represent the electromagnetic field as a multivector.

We shall first use the algebra of physical space (APS) $\text{C}\ell(3, 0)$, which is the Clifford algebra of three-dimensional Euclidean space.

First, let $F$ denote the electromagnetic field as a multivector in the spacetime algebra.
We obviously cannot define $F$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
F = \vb{E} + \vb{B},
\end{equation}
$$

because $\vb{E}$ and $\vb{B}$ are both vectors, and thus they will mix and be unable to be separated.
One way to resolve this is to place the pseudoscalar $i = \sigma_x \sigma_y \sigma_z$ in front of the magnetic field $\vb{B}$, so that we have

$$
\begin{equation}
F = \vb{E} + i \vb{B}.
\end{equation}
$$

Then, we just need to multiply $\vb{B}$ by $c$ to get the correct units, so we have

$$
\begin{equation}
F = \vb{E} + i c \vb{B}.
\end{equation}
$$

That's it; we have defined the electromagnetic field as a multivector in the spacetime algebra.
This was much simpler than the tensor calculus formulation, where we had to define the electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ as $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, where $A_\mu$ is the four-potential.

### Current and Charge Density

Next, we need to define the current and charge density.

Much like in the tensor formulation, we can combine the current density $\vb{J}$ and the charge density $\rho$ into a single object.
This is because they are just spatiotemporal densities, and thus make sense to combine them into a single multivector.
We can define the current and charge density as

$$
\begin{equation}
J = c\rho - \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

It is a combination of a scalar $c\rho$ and a vector $-\vb{J}$, where the scalar is the charge density and the vector is the current density.l

### Maxwell's Equations in Cl(3, 0)

We can now write Maxwell's equations in the Clifford algebra formulation (specifically in the algebra of physical space $\text{C}\ell(3, 0)$).
We shall denote the nabla operator as $\vec{\nabla}$ for the ordinary gradient operator in vector calculus.

The equations are as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, \\
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{B} &= 0, \\
\vec{\nabla} \times \vb{E} &= -\pdv{\vb{B}}{t}, \\
\vec{\nabla} \times \vb{B} &= \mu_0 \vb{J} + \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{\vb{E}}{t},
\end{align}
$$

It is really surprising how simple these equations are in the Clifford algebra formulation.

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} F = \mu_0 cJ.
\end{equation}
$$

*That's it.*

</details>

To derive the equation, we shall convert the equations to the language of multivectors.
Beginning with the Amp√®re-Maxwell law, we rearrange it to get

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \times \vb{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{\vb{E}}{t} = \mu_0 \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

We know that in the APS, the cross product can be expressed as a wedge product along with a pseudoscalar;

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{v} \times \vb{w} = -i (\vb{v} \wedge \vb{w}).
\end{equation}
$$

Hence the law becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
-i\vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B} - \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{\vb{E}}{t} = \mu_0 \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we want to remove the coefficients from the electric field term, so we multiply everything by $c$;

$$
\begin{equation}
-ic \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B} - \partial_{ct} \vb{E} = \mu_0 c \vb{J}
\end{equation}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation}
ic \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B} + \partial_{ct} \vb{E} = -\frac{1}{c \epsilon_0} \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

This equation is still a vector equation, in that both sides are vectors.
The trick we will employ is to convert the other equations to other types of equations, such as scalar or bivector equations.
This way, they are all independent of each other and can be combined into a single equation.

Gauss's law is already a scalar equation, so we can leave it as

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
\end{equation}
$$

We shall now convert Faraday's law to a bivector equation.
Multiplying everything in Faraday's law by $i$, we get

$$
\begin{equation}
i \vec{\nabla} \times \vb{E} + i \pdv{\vb{B}}{t} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

As $i \vec{\nabla} \times \vb{E} = \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{E}$, we can rewrite this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{E} + i \partial_{ct} c \vb{B} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, we can convert Gauss's law for magnetism to a trivector equation by simply multiplying by $ic$;

$$
\begin{equation}
ic \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{B} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Now we will just add all of these equations together.
We have

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&\quad \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{E} \\
&{}+ \partial_{ct} \vb{E} + ic \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B} \\
&{}+ \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{E} + i \partial_{ct} c \vb{B} \\
&{}+ ic \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{B} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} - \frac{1}{c \epsilon_0} \vb{J}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Here's where the magic happens.
Notice that we have a $\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{E}$ term and a $\vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{E}$ term.
The sum of those two is just the definition of a Clifford product

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \vb{E} = \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{E} + \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{E}.
\end{equation}
$$

This leads to the equation

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \vb{E} + \partial_{ct} \vb{E} + ic \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B} + i \partial_{ct} c \vb{B} + ic \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{B} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} - \frac{1}{c \epsilon_0} \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

Likewise, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \vb{B} = \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vb{B} + \vec{\nabla} \wedge \vb{B},
\end{equation}
$$

so we can rewrite the equation as

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \vb{E} + \partial_{ct} \vb{E} + ic \vec{\nabla} {B} + ic \partial_{ct} c \vb{B} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} - \frac{1}{c \epsilon_0} \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, we can define the vector gradient in APS as

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla := \partial_{ct} + \vec{\nabla} = \partial_{ct} + \partial_x \sigma_x + \partial_y \sigma_y + \partial_z \sigma_z,
\end{equation}
$$

and thus we can simplify some terms like this:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vec{\nabla} \vb{E} + \partial_{ct} \vb{E} = \nabla \vb{E}.
\end{equation}
$$

Thus we can rewrite the equation as

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla \vb{E} + ic \nabla \vb{B} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} - \frac{1}{c \epsilon_0} \vb{J}.
\end{equation}
$$

Now we will invoke the definition of the electromagnetic field $F$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
F = \vb{E} + i c \vb{B},
\end{equation}
$$

and the definition of the current and charge density $J$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
J = c \rho - \vb{J},
\end{equation}
$$

to finally get

$$
\begin{equation}
\nabla F = \mu_0 c J.
\end{equation}
$$
