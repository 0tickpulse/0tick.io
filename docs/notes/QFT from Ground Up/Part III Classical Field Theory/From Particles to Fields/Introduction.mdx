# From Particles to Fields

In the previous section, we discussed the Lagrangian formalism and how it can be used to describe the dynamics of a system of particles.
In this section, we will discuss a fundamental shift in perspective: from particles to fields.
We will apply it to an example of the electromagnetic field, from which we will derive the tensor form of Maxwell's equations.

## Introduction

In classical mechanics, we describe the dynamics of a system by specifying the positions and momenta of particles.
For example, the Sun-Earth system can be described by the positions and momenta of the Sun and the Earth.
Then, we introduce forces that act on these particles, such as the gravitational force between the Sun and the Earth:

$$
\begin{equation}
\va{F} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \vu{r}
\end{equation}
$$

Likewise, for two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$, the electrostatic force between them is given by Coulomb's law:

$$
\begin{equation}
\va{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \vu{r}
\end{equation}
$$

In this description, the forces act instantaneously across space.
Any interaction between two objects only requires that the objects are there, and that there is empty space between them.
This is known as **action-at-a-distance**.

However, this is not how the universe works.
There is a fundamental principle in physics known as **locality**, which states that interactions between objects can only occur at the same point in space and time.
This prevents instantaneous transmission of information across space, as it would violate the principles of special relativity.

To see why action-at-a-distance is problematic, consider two events $A$ and $B$ that are spacelike separated (i.e., light cannot travel between them).
If event $A$ affects event $B$, then there must be a causal relationship between them.
If $A$ causes $B$, then we would hope that $A$ always precedes $B$ in all reference frames.
However, if the events are spacelike separated, there are reference frames in which $B$ precedes $A$.
This leads to a contradiction, as causality would be violated.
