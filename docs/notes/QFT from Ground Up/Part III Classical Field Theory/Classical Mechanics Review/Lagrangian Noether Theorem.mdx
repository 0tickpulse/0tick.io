# Lagrangian Noether's Theorem ❤️

In the previous sections, we have seen how the Lagrangian formalism can be used to describe the dynamics of a system.
In this section, we will see how the Lagrangian can be used to derive conservation laws for a system.
In particular, we will see how symmetries of the Lagrangian lead to conservation laws in the form of **Noether's theorem**.

## Symmetries and Conservation Laws

There is a deep connection between symmetries of a system and conservation laws.
In particular, if a system has a symmetry, then there is a corresponding conservation law.

Here are a few examples of symmetries and their corresponding conservation laws:

Here are some more advanced examples:

| <span className="blue">Scale symmetry</span> | <span className="pink">Conservation of dilatation current $D^\mu$</span> |

In the context of the Lagrangian formalism, we can derive these conservation laws using Noether's theorem.
We will start from the basics and derive this theorem from scratch.

### Free Particle

Let's consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a zero-force field, i.e., a free particle.
The Lagrangian for this system is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - V(\vb{r})
\end{equation}
$$

where $V(\vb{r})$ is the potential energy of the particle.
Notice that $V(\vb{r})$ is a function of the position $\vb{r}$, and not the velocity $\vb{v}$.
Since $\vb{F} = -\grad{V}$ and $\vb{F} = \vb{0}$, we have $\grad{V} = \vb{0}$, which implies that $V$ is a constant.
Therefore, we can write $V(\vb{r}) = V_0$, where $V_0$ is a constant:

$$
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - V_0
\end{equation}
$$

We shall take the system to be one-dimensional for simplicity.
Recall from previous derivations that if the path of the particle is varied by a small amount $q(t) \to q(t) + \epsilon \eta (t)$, then the Lagrangian changes by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{L}{\epsilon} = \pdv{L}{x} \eta + \pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \dot{\eta}
\end{equation}
$$

Then, by the product rule, we saw that this gave:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dv{L}{\epsilon} &= \pdv{L}{x} \eta + \dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \eta) - \eta \dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}) \\
&= -\eta \qty(\dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}) - \pdv{L}{x}) + \dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \eta)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The inner-left part of this equation, $\dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}) - \pdv{L}{x}$, equals $m \ddot{x} + \pdv{V}{x}$, and is zero for the real path.
We will call this part the **equation of motion**.
We are now interested in the right part of the equation, $\dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \eta)$.
We shall now define a symmetry as:

<Boxed>
**Simple Symmetry**: A symmetry is a transformation of the form $x \to x + \epsilon \eta(t)$, where $\eta(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time, such that the Lagrangian is constant.
</Boxed>

This is not the most general form of symmetry, but it is the simplest form that we will start with.
Since the potential energy is constant, we have $L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 - V_0$ (as we derived earlier).
Notice that this does not have an explicit dependence on $x$ (only $\dot{x}$), and so that is one form of symmetry - spatial translation invariance.
This occurs when $x \to x + \epsilon \eta_0$, where $\eta_0$ is a constant that represents how much we are translating the system.

When a symmetry occurs, the Lagrangian is invariant under the transformation. This means that $\dv{L}{\epsilon} = 0$.
For the real path, we already have the equation of motion as zero, so we are left with:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}} \eta) = 0
\end{equation}
$$

This means that the quantity $Q = \pdv{L}{\dot{x}} = m \dot{x}$ is conserved.
In other words, **under spatial translation invariance, momentum is conserved**.
This is the first example of Noether's theorem in action.
