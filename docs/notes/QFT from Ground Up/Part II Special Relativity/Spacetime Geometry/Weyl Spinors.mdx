# Weyl Spinors

We have previously seen in quantum mechanics that Pauli matrices are a set of matrices that are used to represent the spin operators for spin-1/2 particles.
Pauli vectors (which are actually matrices) are used to represent the spin states of particles, and they can be factored into the tensor product of two 2-component vectors.
We call these vectors Pauli spinors.

Normally, a vector is rotated using a $\text{SO}(3)$ transformation.
When we transform a Pauli vector, we instead place two $\text{SU}(2)$ transformationson the left and right of the vector, where one is the Hermitian conjugate of the other.
When the Pauli vector is factored, each spinor takes one of the transformations. This is why spinors transform half as much as the vector.

Pauli vectors are associated with three-dimensional space.
However, if we want to make quantum mechanics relativistic, we need a four-dimensional object.
One such object is the **Weyl spinor**.

## Review of Lorentz Transformations

Recall that Lorentz transformations are transformations that preserve the Minkowski metric $\eta$.
In Minkowski geometry, we define the square-magnitude of a vector as

$$
\begin{equation}
\norm{\vb{v}}^2 = \vb{v}^T \eta \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
$$

If we apply a Lorentz transformation $\Lambda$ to a vector $\vb{v}$, and assert that the square-magnitude is invariant, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
(\Lambda \vb{v})^T \eta (\Lambda \vb{v}) = \vb{v}^T \eta \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
$$

We know that the transpose of a product of matrices is the product of the transposes in reverse order.
Thus, we can write the left-hand side as $\vb{v}^T \Lambda^T \eta \Lambda \vb{v}$.
This implies that

$$
\begin{equation}
\Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta.
\end{equation}
$$

The group of transformations satisfying this equation is $\text{O}(1, 3)$, the group of orthogonal transformations in one time and three space dimensions.
If we forbid spatial reflections, we have the group $\text{SO}(1, 3)$, the group of ** orthogonal transformations in one time and three space dimensions.
Finally, if we also forbid time reflections, we have the group $\text{SO}^+(1, 3)$, the group of **proper orthochronous transformations in one time and three space dimensions.
This has the effect of making $\Lambda^0_0$ positive.

We summarize the groups as follows:

1. $\Lambda \in \text{O}(1, 3)$:
    - $\Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta$
2. $\Lambda \in \text{SO}(1, 3)$:
    - $\Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta$
    - $\det(\Lambda) = 1$
3. $\Lambda \in \text{SO}^+(1, 3)$:
    - $\Lambda^T \eta \Lambda = \eta$
    - $\det(\Lambda) = 1$
    - $\Lambda^0_0 > 0$

There are six basic Lorentz transformations, defined by pairs of coordinate axes.
These are shown in the table below.

## Weyl Vectors

Suppose we have a 4-vector $\vb{v} = ct \vb{e}_t + x \vb{e}_x + y \vb{e}_y + z \vb{e}_z$.
Let the time basis vector be $\vb{e}_t = 1$ (to be interpreted as the identity matrix), and the rest be Pauli matrices.
Then we can write the vector as

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V &= ct (1) + x \sigma_x + y \sigma_y + z \sigma_z \\
&= ct \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] + x \mqty[0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0] + y \mqty[0 & -i \\ i & 0] + z \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \\
&= \mqty[ct + z & x - iy \\ x + iy & ct - z].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

This is the **Weyl vector**. There are a few interesting properties about Weyl vectors.
First, the Weyl vector is Hermitian, meaning that $V^\dagger = V$.
Second, the determinant of a Weyl vector is the spacetime interval of its corresponding 4-vector.
This can be proven easily:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\det(V) &= \det(\mqty[ct + z & x - iy \\ x + iy & ct - z]) \\
&= (ct + z)(ct - z) - (x - iy)(x + iy) \\
&= c^2 t^2 - z^2 - (x^2 + y^2) \\
&= (ct)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 \\
&= s^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

### Transformations of Weyl Vectors

Normally, we transform a 4-vector by multiplying it by a Lorentz transformation ($\text{SO}(1, 3)$).
What are its corresponding transformation pairs?

In other words, given a 4-vector $\vb{v}$ that transforms to $\Lambda \vb{v}$, we want to find a transformation pair $A, B$ such that $AVB$ corresponds to $\Lambda \vb{v}$.
To find out, let's first leverage the fact that the Weyl vector is Hermitian; $(AVB)^\dagger = AVB$:

$$
\begin{equation}
B^\dagger V A^\dagger = AVB
\end{equation}
$$

We postulate that this implies $B^\dagger = A$ and $A^\dagger = B$.

Next, we leverage the determinant property of the Weyl vector, $\det(AVB) = \det(V)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\det(AVB) = \det(A) \det(V) \det(B) = \det(V)
\end{equation}
$$

This means that

$$
\begin{equation}
\det(A) \det(B) = \det(A) \det(A^\dagger) = \det(A) \det(A)^* = |\det(A)|^2 = 1
\end{equation}
$$

This means that $\det(A)$ is a complex number of unit modulus, which can be read as $\det(A) = e^{i \phi}$.
We can thus arbitrarily introduce a phase factor $e^{i \phi}$ into the transformation.
Plugging this back into the transformed Weyl vector, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
AVA^\dagger \to (A e^{i \phi} A^\dagger) V (A e^{-i \phi} A^\dagger) = A V A^\dagger
\end{equation}
$$

In other words, adding a phase factor to the transformation does not change the Weyl vector.
This means that there are multiple matrices that represent a single transformation.
To pick one, we can enforce the condition that $\det(A) = 1$.

The transformation that we just derived is a member of the group $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$, the group of $2 \times 2$ complex matrices with determinant 1.
$S$ stands for special, and $L$ stands for linear.

### Matrix Representations of SL(2, C) Transformations

We now seek a specific form of the transformation matrix.
A $2 \times 2$ matrix can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
A = \mqty[\alpha & \beta \\ \gamma & \delta]
\end{equation}
$$

Without any conditions, this matrix has four complex degrees of freedom, or eight real degrees of freedom.
However, we can impose the condition that $\det(A) = 1$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\det(A) = \alpha \delta - \beta \gamma = 1
\end{equation}
$$

Given that the determinant can be written as $\det(A) = r e^{i \phi}$, we reduce the degrees of freedom to six ($r = 1, \phi = 0$).

The six degrees of freedom correspond to the six transformations.
They are given by the following matrices:

### Abstract Form of SL(2, C) Transformations

Alternatively, if we do not want to use matrices, we can use the abstract form of the transformation.
The rotations are the same as Pauli matrices, while the boosts use hyperbolic trigonometric functions instead of the circular ones.

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Boost in $\class{green}{tx}$}: & \quad \cosh(\frac{\phi}{2}) - \sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_t \sigma_x} &&= \mqty[\cosh(\frac{\phi}{2}) & -\sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) \\ -\sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) & \cosh(\frac{\phi}{2})] \\
\text{Boost in $\class{green}{ty}$}: & \quad \cosh(\frac{\phi}{2}) - \sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_t \sigma_y} &&= \mqty[\cosh(\frac{\phi}{2}) & i \sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) \\ i \sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) & \cosh(\frac{\phi}{2})] \\
\text{Boost in $\class{green}{tz}$}: & \quad \cosh(\frac{\phi}{2}) - \sinh(\frac{\phi}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_t \sigma_z} &&= \mqty[e^{-\phi/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{\phi/2}] \\
\text{Rotation in $\class{green}{xy}$}: & \quad \cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) - \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} &&= \mqty[\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) & -i \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ -i \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) & \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})] \\
\text{Rotation in $\class{green}{zx}$}: & \quad \cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) - \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_z \sigma_x} &&= \mqty[\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) & -\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) & \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})] \\
\text{Rotation in $\class{green}{yz}$}: & \quad \cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) - \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \class{green}{\sigma_y \sigma_z} &&= \mqty[\cos(\frac{\theta}{2}) & -i \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ -i \sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) & \cos(\frac{\theta}{2})]
\end{align}
$$

## Weyl Spinors

With the fundamental properties of Weyl vectors and $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ transformations in mind, we can now define Weyl spinors.
Recall that Pauli spinors were obtained by factoring the Pauli vector as a tensor product of two 2-component vectors.
We can do the same with Weyl vectors.

First, we can write the Weyl vector as:

$$
\begin{equation}
V = \mqty[ct + z & x - iy \\ x + iy & ct - z] = \mqty[\alpha \\ \beta] \otimes \mqty[\gamma & \delta]
\end{equation}
$$

In this case, the tensor product is just an outer product. We can write the resulting matrix as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mqty[\alpha \gamma & \alpha \delta \\ \beta \gamma & \beta \delta] = \mqty[ct + z & x - iy \\ x + iy & ct - z]
\end{equation}
$$
