# History of Astronomy: Part 2

Previously, we discussed the history of astronomy, focusing on developments prior to Newtonian mechanics.
In this section, we will continue our exploration of the history of astronomy, focusing on developments from the time of Newton to the present day.

## Galileo and Newton

The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century revolutionized astronomy.
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was one of the first to use a telescope to observe the heavens.
He was the first to propose a version of Newton's first law, as well as the kinematic principles of acceleration.
Using his telescope, Galileo made several important discoveries, including:

- The Milky Way is actually composed of a vast number of individual stars, instead of being a nebulous cloud as previously thought.
- The four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) orbit the planet, providing strong evidence against the geocentric model of the universe.
- The phases of Venus, which could only be explained by a heliocentric model (as the sun's light illuminates different portions of Venus as it orbits the sun).
- The rough and uneven surface of the Moon, which contradicted the Aristotelian idea of perfect celestial spheres.
- Sunspots on the surface of the Sun, indicating that the Sun is not a perfect, unchanging body.

Galileo's observations provided strong evidence in favor of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, and they challenged the prevailing Aristotelian view of the cosmos.
The Catholic Church, which held significant influence over intellectual life in Europe at the time, challenged Galileo's findings.
In 1616, The Holy Office declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical."
Galileo was also warned by Cardinal Roberto Bellarmine not to "hold, teach, or defend" the heliocentric view.

In 1623, however, his friend and admirer Cardinal Maffeo Barberini became Pope Urban VIII, and Galileo was given permission to write about heliocentrism as a hypothesis.
He published his findings in "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632, which presented arguments for both the geocentric and heliocentric models.
While it was technically neutral, the book was clearly biased in favor of heliocentrism.
The character representing the heliocentric view was named "Salviati," after Galileo's friend and supporter, while the character representing the geocentric view was named "Simplicio," which was interpreted as a derogatory term meaning "simpleton."
As a result, Galileo was tried by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633 and found "vehemently suspect of heresy."
He was forced to recant his views and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.

Despite the controversy surrounding Galileo's work, his observations laid the groundwork for future developments in astronomy and physics.
Eventually, in 1992, Pope John Paul II formally acknowledged the errors made by the Church in its handling of the Galileo affair.

Isaac Newton (1643–1727) built upon the work of Galileo and others to develop a comprehensive theory of motion and gravitation.
While the Plague ravaged Europe in 1665, Newton retreated to his family estate in Woolsthorpe, where he made several groundbreaking discoveries.
His Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), published in 1687, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.
In the Principia, Newton formulated his three laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation, as well as differential and integral calculus (independently developed by Leibniz).
He also published his work on optics in Optiks in 1704, where he described the nature of light and color.

Newton was one of the most intelligent and influential scientists in history.
When faced with the Brachistochrone problem, he solved it in a single night, inventing the calculus of variations in the process.
By Newton's request, his solution was published anonymously in the 1696 edition of the Journal des Sçavans.
Bernoulli, who had posed the problem, recognized Newton's solution and famously remarked, "I recognize the lion by his claw."

We should be vehemently familiar with Newton's laws of motion and gravitation, as they form the basis of classical mechanics.
Nevertheless, it is worth briefly reviewing them here. We will do so by deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from Newton's law of gravitation.
We must first establish the necessary mathematical tools.

### Center-of-Mass Reference Frame

In a system of particles, the center of mass (COM) is the weighted average position of all the particles, where the weights are given by their masses.
For a system of $N$ particles with masses $m_i$ and positions $\vb{r}_i$, the position of the center of mass $\vb{R}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{R} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vb{r}_i,
\end{equation}
$$

where $M = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i$ is the total mass of the system.

If we rearrange and differentiate this equation, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M \dv{\vb{R}}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dv{\vb{r}_i}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vb{v}_i = \vb{P},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{P}$ is the total momentum of the system.
Differentiating again, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{\vb{P}}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dv{\vb{v}_i}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dv{\vb{p}_i}{t}.
\end{equation}
$$

Anyways, suppose we have a binary system of two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and positions $\vb{r}_1$ and $\vb{r}_2$.
Let their center of mass be the origin, i.e., $\vb{R} = 0$.
Let $\vb{r}$ be the relative position vector from particle 1 to particle 2, i.e., $\vb{r} = \vb{r}_2 - \vb{r}_1$.
Each particle can then be expressed in terms of the center of mass and the relative position vector as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{r}_1 &= -\frac{m_2}{M} \vb{r}, \\
\vb{r}_2 &= \frac{m_1}{M} \vb{r}.
\end{align}
$$

If we define the **reduced mass** $\mu$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu := \frac{m_1 m_2}{M} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2},
\end{equation}
$$

then each particle's position is

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{r}_1 &= -\frac{\mu}{m_1} \vb{r}, \\
\vb{r}_2 &= \frac{\mu}{m_2} \vb{r}.
\end{align}
$$

There are a few useful identities that we can derive from this.
First, Newton's third law gives $m_1 \vb{a}_1 = -m_2 \vb{a}_2$, so if we define the relative acceleration $\vb{a} := \vb{a}_2 - \vb{a}_1$, then

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{a} := \vb{a}_2 - \vb{a}_1 = \qty(1 + \frac{m_2}{m_1}) \vb{a}_2 = \frac{M}{m_1 m_2} m_1 \vb{a}_1 = \frac{1}{\mu} \vb{F}_{12},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{F}_{12}$ is the force on particle 1 due to particle 2. This means

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu \vb{a} = \vb{F}_{12}.
\end{equation}
$$

This means that we can treat the two-body problem as a one-body problem with mass $\mu$ moving under the influence of the force $\vb{F}_{12}$.
Second, the total kinetic energy of the system is

$$
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} \mu v^2,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{v} = \vb{v}_2 - \vb{v}_1$ is the relative velocity.
Third, the total angular momentum of the system about the center of mass is

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{L} = \vb{r}_1 \times m_1 \vb{v}_1 + \vb{r}_2 \times m_2 \vb{v}_2 = \mu \vb{r} \times \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
$$

The gravitational potential energy of the system is

$$
\begin{equation}
U = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r} = -\frac{G \mu M}{r}.
\end{equation}
$$

### Kepler's First Law

### Virial Theorem

One important result that we will need is the virial theorem.
For a stable, bound system of particles interacting through a potential $U(\vb{r})$, the virial theorem states that

$$
\begin{equation}
\expval{E} = \frac{1}{2} \expval{U},
\end{equation}
$$

where $E$ is the total kinetic energy of the system, and the angle brackets denote a time average.
(Of course, this is only true for potentials that are homogeneous functions of degree $n = -1$, such as the gravitational potential.)
The angle brackets can be formally defined as a functional of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
\expval{\phi} := \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \phi(t) \dd{t},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\tau$ is the time period over which the average is taken.
