# History of Astrophysics

Astronomy and astrophysics have a rich history that spans thousands of years.
In particular, astronomy has been practiced since ancient times, so ancient that it could have been the first scientific discipline.
Ancient civilizations were keen observers of the night sky, and they developed various methods to track celestial objects.
Geological evidence suggests that the first astronomical observations were made by prehistoric humans, who used simple tools to observe the stars and planets.
Such evidence includes cave paintings and carvings that depict celestial objects, such as the Moon and stars.
The ancient Egyptians, for example, built the pyramids in alignment with the stars, and they used the heliacal rising of Sirius to mark the start of their new year.

The motion of celestial objects was observed and recorded by ancient civilizations, leading to the development of calendars and timekeeping systems.
Clocks leveraged the regular motion of celestial objects, such as the Sun and Moon, to measure time.
Sundials, for example, used the position of the Sun in the sky to indicate the time of day.

In this section, we will explore the history of astronomy and astrophysics, from its ancient origins to modern times.

## Greek Astronomy

The modern, scientific study of astronomy began with the ancient Greeks who treated astronomy as a branch of mathematics.
Due to the limited technology available at the time, the Greeks lacked sophisticated telescopes and other instruments.
However, they made significant contributions to the field of astronomy through careful observations and logical reasoning.

The term planet comes from the Greek word πλανήτης (planētēs), which means "wanderer."
The initial model was one in which the Earth was at the center, and all celestial objects moved in perfect circles around it.
This model, known as a **geocentric** (geo meaning "Earth") model, was proposed by philosophers such as Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 408-355 BCE) and later refined by Plato (c. 428-348 BCE) and Aristotle (384-322 BCE).
It was the dominant model because it seemed obviously true by observation: the Sun, Moon, and stars all appeared to move in circular paths around the Earth.

As the stars moved in a circular path, their motion could be easily observed and predicted.
Each star had a position $\vb{r}(t)$ that obeyed a simple equation of motion.
Defining the origin of the coordinate system at the center of the Earth, the position vector evolves over time according to

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{r}(t + \Delta t) = R_\text{(axis)}(\Delta t) \vb{r}(t),
\end{equation}
$$

where $R_\text{(axis)}(\Delta t)$ is a rotation matrix that rotates the position vector $\vb{r}(t)$ by an angle proportional to the time interval $\Delta t$.
(Obviously, this mathematical notation is not from the time of Plato, but it is a modern representation of the idea.)

With this model, we are able to easily predict not only the positions, but also the velocities, accelerations, energies, and other physical quantities that describe the motion of celestial objects.
This allows for a complete description of the motion of celestial objects in the sky.
However, the geocentric model was not without its problems.

### Retrograde Motion

One of the major problems with the geocentric model was the phenomenon of retrograde motion.
As a planet moves in its orbit, it appears to move in the opposite direction for a period of time.
This is known as **apparent retrograde motion**.
The most famous example of retrograde motion is that of Mars, which appears to move in the opposite direction for a few months every two years, as shown in the image below.

Hipparchus (c. 190-120 BCE) proposed a solution where the planets moved in a circular path (an **epicycle**) around a point that itself moved in a circular path around the Earth (the **deferent**).
In other words, the planets moved in a circular path around a point that itself moved in a circular path around the Earth.
Mathematically, this looks like adding another circular motion to the original circular motion.
If the original circular motion is given by $\vb{r}_\text{(deferent)}(t)$, then the position vector of the planet is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{r}_\text{(planet)}(t + \Delta t) = \vb{r}_\text{(deferent)}(t + \Delta t) + R_\text{(epicycle)}(\Delta t) \vb{r}_\text{(epicycle)}(t),
\end{equation}
$$

where $R_\text{(epicycle)}(\Delta t)$ is a rotation matrix that rotates the position vector $\vb{r}_\text{(epicycle)}(t)$ by an angle proportional to the time interval $\Delta t$.
These two circular motions together create a more complex motion that can explain the retrograde motion of planets.

:::info Remark

Technically, adding on more circles allows for any motion to be described ([Fourier series](../../Part%200%20Math%20Boosters/Fourier%20Series.mdx)), but not only was this not known at the time, it also made the model more complicated than it needed to be.

:::

Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100-170 CE) later refined this model by introducing the concept of **equants** (or punctum aequans).
An equant is a point that is not the center of the deferent, but is used to define the motion of the planet.
Specifically, the center of the epicycle (or the **eccentric**) moves with a constant angular velocity around the equant, instead of the center of the deferent.

This model, known as the **Ptolemaic system**, was able to make better predictions of the positions of planets, but it was still not perfect.
For one, the model was needlessly complicated; it forsook the simplicity of uniform, circular motion for a more complex model that was not as elegant.
Furthermore, in order to make the model align with new observations, new epicycles and equants had to be added, which made the model even more complicated.
This led to the model becoming increasingly complex and unwieldy, with many epicycles and equants being added to explain the motion of planets.

### Copernicus and the Heliocentric Model

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), a Polish mathematician and astronomer, proposed a new model of the solar system in which the Sun was at the center, and the planets moved in circular orbits around it.
This model, known as the **heliocentric** (helio meaning "Sun") model, was a radical departure from the geocentric model.
Immediately, it gave a much simpler description of the motion of planets, as it eliminated the need for epicycles and equants.
This was the first heliocentric model that was supported by evidence, and it was a major breakthrough in the history of astronomy.

The problem, however, was that during his time, the Catholic Church held the geocentric model as a theological doctrine.
The idea of the Earth moving around the Sun was seen as heretical, and Copernicus feared persecution for his ideas.
Therefore, he published his work, "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres"), only shortly before his death in 1543.
One approach at the time was to claim that the heliocentric model was just a mathematical tool, but does not reflect reality.

Mathematically, we can formulate the heliocentric model as follows.
Let the origin of the coordinate system be at the center of the Sun.
Then, the position vector of a planet is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{r}_\text{(planet)}(t + \Delta t) = R_\text{(axis)}(\Delta t) \vb{r}_\text{(planet)}(t),
\end{equation}
$$

where $R_\text{(axis)}(\Delta t)$ is a rotation matrix that rotates the position vector $\vb{r}_\text{(planet)}(t)$ by an angle proportional to the time interval $\Delta t$.
The rotation of each planet can be characterized by parameters such as the orbital radius and the angular velocity.
