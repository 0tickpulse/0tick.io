# Additional Topic: Astrophysics

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole.
Astrophysics is a branch of astronomy that applies the principles of physics and chemistry to understand how stars, galaxies, and the universe evolve.

For this section, we will follow Carroll and Ostlie's "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics" as a reference.
