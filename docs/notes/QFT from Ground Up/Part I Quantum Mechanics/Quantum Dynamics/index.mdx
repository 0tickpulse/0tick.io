# Quantum Dynamics

Up to this point, we have discussed the basic principles of quantum mechanics, including the postulates and mathematical formalism.
We have not yet discussed how quantum systems evolve in time.
There are typically three ways to describe the time evolution of quantum systems.
The first is the Schr√∂dinger picture, where the state of the system, $\ket{\psi}$, evolves in time.
The second is the Heisenberg picture, where the operators themselves evolve in time.
The third is a different approach called the path integral formalism developed by Richard Feynman.
