# Time Evolution of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator

Previously, we deried all the important results of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
We will now use these results to study the time evolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator from multiple approaches.
First, we will use the Heisenberg picture, and then we will use Feynman path integrals.

## Heisenberg Picture

Recall that

$$
\begin{align}
\dv{p_i}{t} &= -\pdv{x_i} V(\vb{x}), \\
\dv{x_i}{t} &= \frac{p_i}{m}.
\end{align}
$$

We know that $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2$ for the harmonic oscillator.
Thus, the first equation becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{p}{t} = -m \omega^2 x.
\end{equation}
$$

There are a few ways to solve this system of equations.
One enlightening way is to consider the phase space and use matrices to represent the equations.
We will instead first rewrite the equations using the creation and annihilation operators.

First,

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{a}{t} = \dv{t} \qty[\sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}} \qty(x + \frac{i}{m \omega} p)] = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}} \qty[\frac{p}{m} - i \omega x] = -i \omega a,
\end{equation}
$$

where we have used the equations of motion for $x$ and $p$.
Similarly, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{a^\dagger}{t} = \dv{t} \qty[\sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}} \qty(x - \frac{i}{m \omega} p)] = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}} \qty[\frac{p}{m} + i \omega x] = i \omega a^\dagger.
\end{equation}
$$

The solutions to these equations are obvious; these are just complex exponentials:

$$
\begin{align}
a(t) &= e^{-i \omega t} a(0), \\
a^\dagger(t) &= e^{i \omega t} a^\dagger(0).
\end{align}
$$
