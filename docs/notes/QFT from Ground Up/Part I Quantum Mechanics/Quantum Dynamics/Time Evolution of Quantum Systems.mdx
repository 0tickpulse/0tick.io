# Time Evolution of Quantum Systems

Up to this point, we have discussed the basic principles of quantum mechanics, including the postulates and mathematical formalism.
We have not yet discussed how quantum systems evolve in time.
There are typically three ways to describe the time evolution of quantum systems.
The first is the Schrödinger picture, where the state of the system, $\ket{\psi}$, evolves in time.
The second is the Heisenberg picture, where the operators themselves evolve in time.
The third is a different approach called the path integral formalism developed by Richard Feynman.
We will go through all three of these methods eventually, but we will start with the Schrödinger picture.
In this section, we will derive the third postulate of quantum mechanics, which requires that the time evolution of quantum systems be governed by a unitary operator.

## Time-Evolution Operator

The time-evolution operator is an operator that describes how a quantum system evolves in time.
Suppose we have a quantum system described by a state vector $\ket{\psi}$ at time $t_0$.
At some other time $t > t_0$, the state of the system will be described by another state vector.
Sakurai uses the notation $\ket{\psi, t_0; t}$ to denote the state of the system at time $t$ given that it was in the state $\ket{\psi}$ at time $t_0$.

First, if $t = t_0$, then the state of the system at time $t$ is the same as the state of the system at time $t_0$.
Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{t \to t_0} \ket{\psi, t_0; t} = \ket{\psi, t_0; t_0} = \ket{\psi, t_0} = \ket{\psi} \label{eq:time-evolution-operator-initial-condition}
\end{equation}
$$

Next, suppose we have a time-evolution operator $U(t; t_0)$ that describes how the state of the system evolves from time $t_0$ to time $t$.
Then, the state of the system at time $t$ is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi, t_0; t} = U(t; t_0) \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

From physical intuition, we expect the time-evolution operator to follow the following properties:

- Equation $\eqref{eq:time-evolution-operator-initial-condition}$ can be written as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t_0, t_0) = I \label{eq:time-evolution-operator-identity}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $I$ is the identity operator.
- The time-evolution operator should be invertible because we should be able to evolve the state of the system backwards in time.
    This means that there should exist an operator $U^{-1}(t; t_0)$ such that:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t; t_0) U^{-1}(t; t_0) = U^{-1}(t; t_0) U(t; t_0) = I
    \end{equation}
    $$
- The operator should follow this composition property:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t_2, t_1) U(t_1, t_0) = U(t_2, t_0)
    \end{equation}
    $$
- The total probability of the system should be conserved.
    Since the total probability is equal to $\braket{\psi}{\psi}$, we should have:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \braket{U \psi}{U \psi} = \braket{\psi}{\psi}
    \end{equation}
    $$

The last condition is very interesting.
Recall that the Hermitian conjugate allows us to move $U$ to the right side of the inner product:

$$
\begin{equation}
\braket{U \psi}{U \psi} = \braket{\psi}{U^\dagger U \psi}
\end{equation}
$$

Since this must be equal to $\braket{\psi}{\psi}$, we must have:

$$
\begin{equation}
U^\dagger U = I
\end{equation}
$$

This property is very important and it has a name; the time-evolution operator must be an **unitary operator**.
(Recall that we have already seen unitary operators in the context of the transformations of the Jones vectors in the polarization of light.)

## Schrödinger Equation

Consider a quantum system described by a state vector $\ket{\psi, t_0}$ at time $t_0$.
Now suppose we want to find the state of the system at time $t_0 + \Delta t$ (a very small time interval after $t_0$).

From Equation $\eqref{eq:time-evolution-operator-initial-condition}$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \ket{\psi, t_0; t_0 + \Delta t} = \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore, the time-evolution operator $U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0)$ must be very close to the identity operator:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) = I
\end{equation}
$$

We can expand $U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0)$ in a Taylor series about $\Delta t = 0$:

$$
\begin{equation}
U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) = I + \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t^2}
\end{equation}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\begin{equation}
U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) - I = \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t^2}
\end{equation}
$$

From $\eqref{eq:time-evolution-operator-identity}$, we have $I = U(t_0, t_0)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) - U(t_0, t_0) = \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t^2}
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, dividing by $\Delta t$ gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) - U(t_0, t_0)}{\Delta t} = \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t}
\end{equation}
$$

Now, we apply both sides of the equation to the state vector $\ket{\psi, t_0}$:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) - U(t_0, t_0)}{\Delta t} \ket{\psi, t_0} &= \dot{U}(0) \ket{\psi, t_0} \\
\frac{\ket{\psi, t_0; t_0 + \Delta t} - \ket{\psi, t_0}}{\Delta t} &= \dot{U}(0) \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{align}
$$

Taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$ gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\ket{\psi, t_0; t_0 + \Delta t} - \ket{\psi, t_0}}{\Delta t} = \dot{U}(0) \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

This is the definition of the derivative of the state vector with respect to time. Thus:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{t} \ket{\psi, t_0} = \dot{U}(0) \ket{\psi, t_0} \label{eq:schrodinger-equation-derivative}
\end{equation}
$$

To continue from here, consider the term $\dot{U}(0)$.
Since $U$ is a unitary operator, we have $U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0)^\dagger U(t_0 + \Delta t; t_0) = I$.
Expanding this out in a Taylor series (about $\Delta t = 0$) gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
I &= (I + \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t^2})^\dagger (I + \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \order{\Delta t^2}) \\
&= I + \Delta t \dot{U}(0) + \Delta t \dot{U}(0)^\dagger + \order{\Delta t^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The $I$ terms cancel out, and we are left with (after dividing by $\Delta t$ and taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$):

$$
\begin{equation}
\dot{U}(0) + \dot{U}(0)^\dagger = 0
\end{equation}
$$

Or,

$$
\begin{equation}
\dot{U}(0) = -\dot{U}(0)^\dagger
\end{equation}
$$

This is the definition of an **anti-Hermitian operator**; we have previously seen it in the context of commutators.

The key insight comes when we try to evaluate $(i\dot{U}(0))^\dagger$.
From the product rule for the Hermitian conjugate, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
(i\dot{U}(0))^\dagger = i^\dagger \dot{U}(0)^\dagger = (-i)(-\dot{U}(0)) = i\dot{U}(0)
\end{equation}
$$

In other words, $(i\dot{U}(0))^\dagger = i\dot{U}(0)$, and so it must be Hermitian.
Denote this operator as $\Omega$. Thus, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Omega = i\dot{U}(0)
\end{equation}
$$

So $\dot{U}$ can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dot{U}(0) = \frac{\Omega}{i}
\end{equation}
$$

Going back to Equation $\eqref{eq:schrodinger-equation-derivative}$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{t} \ket{\psi, t_0} = \frac{\Omega}{i} \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

Rearranging $i$ to the left gives:

$$
\begin{equation}
i \dv{t} \ket{\psi, t_0} = \Omega \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

The Appendix outlines the connection between the time-evolution operator and the Hamiltonian of a system:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{L}{t} = -\dv{H}{t}
\end{equation}
$$

It looks very close to the previous equation given above; $L \to \ket{\psi}$ and $H \to \Omega$.
As such, we can define $\Omega$ as the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{H}{\hbar}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
i \dv{t} \ket{\psi, t_0} = \frac{H}{\hbar} \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$

Rearranging this gives the **Schrödinger equation**:

<Boxed>
**Schrödinger Equation**: The time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \dv{t} \ket{\psi, t_0} = H \ket{\psi, t_0}
\end{equation}
$$
</Boxed>

Alternatively, we can write the Schrödinger equation in terms of the time-evolution operator $U$:

<Boxed>
**Schrödinger Equation (Time-Evolution Operator Form)**: The time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \dv{t} U(t; t_0) = H U(t; t_0)
\end{equation}
$$
</Boxed>

The reason the $\hbar$ in this context is equal to the $\hbar$ in the translation operator is because it is required to create a relationship like:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{\va{r}}{t} = \frac{\va{p}}{m}
\end{equation}
$$

### Solving the Schrödinger Equation

For the time-evolution operator form of the Schrödinger equation, we can solve it depending on the form of the Hamiltonian.

1. **Time-Independent Hamiltonian**: If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, which corresponds to systems with fixed energies, then the time-evolution operator can be written as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t; t_0) = \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H (t - t_0))
    \end{equation}
    $$

    When the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the Schrödinger equation is simply an exponential-like differential equation of the form $\dv{y}{x} = \lambda y$.

2. **Time-Dependent, Commuting Hamiltonians**: If the Hamiltonians at different times commute, then the time-evolution operator can be written as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t; t_0) = \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{t_0}^{t} H(t') \dd{t'})
    \end{equation}
    $$

3. **Time-Dependent, Non-Commuting Hamiltonians**: If the Hamiltonians at different times do not commute, then the time-evolution operator can be written as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    U(t; t_0) = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \qty(-\frac{i}{\hbar})^n \int_{t_0}^{t} \dd{t_1} \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \dd{t_2} \cdots \int_{t_0}^{t_{n-1}} \dd{t_n} H(t_1) H(t_2) \cdots H(t_n)
    \end{equation}
    $$

    This is known as the **Dyson series**, named after Freeman J. Dyson.

## Time-Independent Hamiltonians

For now on, we will consider the case where the Hamiltonian is time-independent.
In this case, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to the first case:

$$
\begin{equation}
U(t; t_0) = \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H (t - t_0))
\end{equation}
$$

To find out how $U(t; t_0)$ acts on a state vector $\ket{\psi}$, it is useful to first know how it acts on the eigenstates of whatever operator we are considering.
It is convenient to choose an operator $A$ such that $\comm{A}{H} = 0$.
Then, the eigenstates of $A$ are also eigenstates of $H$, known as **energy eigenkets**.
Their eigenvalues are denoted by $E_{a'}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
H\ket{a'} = E_{a'} \ket{a'}
\end{equation}
$$

Then, applying the completeness relation to the time-evolution operator twice and setting $t_0 = 0$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H t) = \sum_{a'} \sum_{a''} \dyad{a''} \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} Ht) \dyad{a'}
\end{equation}
$$

And since $\ket{a'}$ are eigenstates of $H$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H t) \dyad{a'} = \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} E_{a'} t) \dyad{a'}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus the time-evolution operator can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
U(t) = \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H t) = \sum_{a'} \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} E_{a'} t) \dyad{a'}
\end{equation}
$$

Then, acting on a state vector $\ket{\psi}$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
U(t) \ket{\psi} &= \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H t) \sum_{a'} c_{a'} \ket{a'} \\
&= \sum_{a'} \ket{a'} \braket{a'}{\psi} \exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar} E_{a'} t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

## Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

With the Schrödinger equation, we have now derived the third postulate of quantum mechanics.
We are now ready to partially state all the postulates of quantum mechanics:

1. **State Space**: The state of a quantum system is described by a state vector $\ket{\psi}$ in a Hilbert space.
    a. The state of a composite system is described by the tensor product of the component systems.
2. **Observables**: Observables are represented by Hermitian operators.
    a. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator.
    b. Immediately after a measurement, the state of the system is the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.
    c. The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the Born rule: $P = \abs{\braket{x}{\phi}}^2$.
    d. The expectation value of an observable is given by the inner product of the state vector and the operator.
3. **Unitary Evolution**: The time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation.
    a. The time-evolution operator is a unitary operator.
    b. The time-evolution operator obeys the Schrödinger equation.

There are, of course, more details to each of these postulates, but this is a good starting point.
