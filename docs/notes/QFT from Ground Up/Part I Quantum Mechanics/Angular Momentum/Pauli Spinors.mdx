# Pauli Spinors

Previously, we introduced the Pauli formalism, which involves using the Pauli sigma matrices as basis vectors.
In this section, we will explore the Pauli spinors, which are two-component complex vectors that represent the state of a spin-1/2 particle.
More specifically, we will focus on how Pauli vectors can be factored into two-component complex vectors, which are known as Pauli spinors.

## Factoring Matrices

Consider a matrix $A$ that can be factored into a column vector $\vb{a}$ and a row vector $\vb{b}^T$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
A = \vb{a} \vb{b}^T.
\end{equation}
$$

Suppose we are in a two-dimensional space, then we can write all of this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\mqty[a & b \\ c & d] = \mqty[e \\ f] \mqty[g & h].
\end{equation}
$$

This means that we can write the matrix $A$ as a product of two vectors, one column vector and one row vector.
We have already seen that this operation, the outer product, is helpful in quantum mechanics.

Only certain matrices can be factored in this way, and they are known as rank-1 matrices.
These matrices have zero determinant.

Now suppose we have successfully factored a matrix $A$ into a column vector $\vb{a}$ and a row vector $\vb{b}^T$,

$$
\begin{equation}
A = \mqty[a \\ b] \mqty[c & d].
\end{equation}
$$

There is ambiguity here, because we can insert $1$ into the middle and rewrite $1$ as any complex number $z$:

$$
\begin{equation}
A = \mqty[a \\ b] \mqty[c & d] = \mqty[a \\ b] z z^{-1} \mqty[c & d] = \mqty[a z \\ b z] \mqty[z^{-1} c & z^{-1} d].
\end{equation}
$$

Is there a unique, unambiguous way to factor a matrix into a column vector and a row vector?
We can enforce this by requiring that the top of the column vector is $1$.
This gives us a unique factorization of the matrix,

$$
\begin{equation}
\mqty[a \\ b] \mqty[c & d] = \mqty[1 \\ b/a] \mqty[ac & ad].
\end{equation}
$$

## Factoring Pauli Vectors

Recall that a Pauli vector is a vector of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
V = \mqty[z & x - iy \\ x + iy & -z].
\end{equation}
$$

For us to be able to factor this into a column vector and a row vector, we need to ensure that the determinant of the Pauli vector is zero.
Since the determinant is just the negative norm of the vector, we require that

$$
\begin{equation}
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0. \label{eq:pauli-norm-0}
\end{equation}
$$

Such a vector is known as a **null vector** or **isotropic vector**.
It requires that either all three components are zero, or some of them are complex.
Anyways, let's factor the Pauli vector into a column vector and a row vector,

$$
\begin{equation}
V = \mqty[z & x - iy \\ x + iy & -z] = \mqty[a \\ b] \mqty[c & d].
\end{equation}
$$

We have, trivially, that

$$
\begin{align}
ac &= z, \\
bc &= x + iy, \\
ad &= x - iy, \\
bd &= -z.
\end{align}
$$

First, let's write $z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.
This is a simple rearrangement of $\eqref{eq:pauli-norm-0}$,

$$
\begin{align}
(-z)^2 &= -x^2 - y^2, \\
-z &= -\sqrt{-x^2 - y^2} = \sqrt{x - iy} \sqrt{-x - iy}.
\end{align}
$$

From here we can choose $a = \sqrt{x - iy}$ and $c = -\sqrt{-x - iy}$.

We can plug these values into $ad$:

$$
\begin{equation}
x - iy = ad = \sqrt{x - iy} d.
\end{equation}
$$

This implies that $d = \sqrt{x - iy} = a$.
Finally, we can plug $c = -\sqrt{-x - iy}$ into $bc = x + iy$:

$$
\begin{equation}
x + iy = bc = \sqrt{-x - iy} b.
\end{equation}
$$

This implies that $b = \sqrt{-x - iy} = -c$.
Therefore we have

$$
\begin{align}
a &= \sqrt{x - iy}, \\
b &= \sqrt{-x - iy}, \\
c &= -b, \\
d &= a.
\end{align}
$$

We can summarize this as

$$
\begin{equation}
\mqty[z & x - iy \\ x + iy & -z] = \mqty[\sqrt{x - iy} \\ \sqrt{-x - iy}] \mqty[-\sqrt{-x - iy} & \sqrt{x - iy}].
\end{equation}
$$

We shall make a definition to make this more readable.
Let

$$
\begin{equation}
\xi^1 := \sqrt{x - iy}, \quad \xi^2 := \sqrt{-x - iy}.
\end{equation}
$$

Then we can rewrite the Pauli vector as

$$
\begin{equation}
V = \mqty[\xi^1 \\ \xi^2] \mqty[-\xi^2 & \xi^1].
\end{equation}
$$

The components $x$, $y$, and $z$ can be expressed in terms of $\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
x &= \frac{1}{2} \qty(\xi^1 \xi^1 - \xi^2 \xi^2), \\
y &= \frac{i}{2} \qty(\xi^1 \xi^1 + \xi^2 \xi^2), \\
z &= -\xi^1 \xi^2.
\end{align}
$$

And finally, we can remove the ambiguity by requiring that the top component of the column vector is $1$.
This gives us

$$
\begin{equation}
V = \mqty[1 \\ \xi^2 / \xi^1] \xi^1 \mqty[-\xi^2 & \xi^1].
\end{equation}
$$

The column vector $\mqty[1 \\ \xi^2 / \xi^1]$ is known as a **Pauli spinor**.
Note that different Pauli spinors with the same ratio $\xi^2 / \xi^1$ are considered different Pauli spinors.
However, they correspond to the same Pauli vector.

## Transformation of Pauli Spinors

Recall that under a rotation, Pauli vectors transform by a negative conjugation with a $\text{SU}(2)$ matrix,

$$
\begin{equation}
V \to [\text{SU}(2)] V [\text{SU}(2)]^\dagger.
\end{equation}
$$

If we factor $V$ like we did above, we can see how the Pauli spinors transform;

$$
\begin{equation}
V \to [\text{SU}(2)] \mqty[\xi^1 \\ \xi^2] \mqty[-\xi^2 & \xi^1] [\text{SU}(2)]^\dagger.
\end{equation}
$$

We can group them like this:

$$
\begin{equation}
V \to \underbrace{[\text{SU}(2)] \mqty[\xi^1 \\ \xi^2]}_\text{Transformed spinor} \underbrace{\mqty[-\xi^2 & \xi^1] [\text{SU}(2)]^\dagger}_\text{Transformed spinor}.
\end{equation}
$$

This shows that the Pauli spinors transform with one $\text{SU}(2)$ matrix, while the Pauli vector transforms with two $\text{SU}(2)$ matrices.
This finally creates a solid mathematical explanation for the half-rotation property of spinors, like we have seen with Jones vectors and quantum spin states.

## Spinor Spaces

We will now discuss the abstract algebraic structure of Pauli spinors.
This discussion requires some prior knowledge of tensor products, which I included a brief overview of [here](../../Part%200%20Math%20Boosters/Tensors).

Spinors are elements of a vector space known as a **spinor space**.
The spinor space is a two-dimensional complex vector space, which can be denoted as $\mathbb{C}^2$.
We write that

$$
\begin{equation}
\xi \in \mathcal{S} = \mathbb{C}^2.
\end{equation}
$$

Dual spiniors are elements of the dual space of the spinor space, which is denoted as $\mathcal{S}^*$,

$$
\begin{equation}
\zeta \in \mathcal{S}^* = (\mathbb{C}^2)^*.
\end{equation}
$$

Just like a vector, we can write a spinor as a linear combination of basis vectors.
Similarly, we can write a dual spinor as a linear combination of dual basis vectors.

$$
\begin{align}
\xi &= \xi^1 s_1 + \xi^2 s_2, \\
\zeta &= \zeta_1 s^1 + \zeta_2 s^2.
\end{align}
$$

The spinor components $\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ are covariant, while the dual spinor components $\zeta_1$ and $\zeta_2$ are contravariant.

### Pauli Spinors as Tensor Products

Now let's consider how we can write a Pauli vector using spinors.
In abstract form, a Pauli vector's components are written as $V^a_b$, where $a$ and $b$ are indices that can take values $1$ or $2$.

We can thus write

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
V &= \mqty[z & x - iy \\ x + iy & -z] \\
&= z \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0] + (x - iy) \mqty[0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0] + (x + iy) \mqty[0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0] - z \mqty[0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \\
&= z \mqty[1 \\ 0] \otimes \mqty[1 & 0] + (x - iy) \mqty[0 \\ 1] \otimes \mqty[0 & 1] + (x + iy) \mqty[0 \\ 1] \otimes \mqty[1 & 0] - z \mqty[0 \\ 1] \otimes \mqty[0 & 1] \\
&= V^1_1 s_1 \otimes s^1 + V^2_2 s_2 \otimes s^2 + V^1_2 s_1 \otimes s^2 + V^2_1 s_2 \otimes s^1.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

In Einstein notation, we can write this as

$$
\begin{equation}
V = V^a_b s_a \otimes s^b,
\end{equation}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation}
V = V^a_b \ket{s_a} \bra{s^b}.
\end{equation}
$$

We can perform this procedure for the basis Pauli matrices as well, which yield

$$
\begin{align}
\sigma_x &= \mqty[0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0] = 0 s_1 \otimes s^1 + 1 s_1 \otimes s^2 + 1 s_2 \otimes s^1 + 0 s_2 \otimes s^2, \\
\sigma_y &= \mqty[0 & -i \\ i & 0] = 0 s_1 \otimes s^1 + (-i) s_1 \otimes s^2 + i s_2 \otimes s^1 + 0 s_2 \otimes s^2, \\
\sigma_z &= \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1] = 1 s_1 \otimes s^1 + 0 s_1 \otimes s^2 + 0 s_2 \otimes s^1 - 1 s_2 \otimes s^2.
\end{align}
$$

### Sigma Matrices as Linear Maps

We can also view the Pauli matrices as linear maps from the 3D vector space to the spinor space.
We define the map $\sigma$ such that

$$
\begin{align}
\sigma(\vb{e}_x) &= \sigma_x = \mqty[0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0], \\
\sigma(\vb{e}_y) &= \sigma_y = \mqty[0 & -i \\ i & 0], \\
\sigma(\vb{e}_z) &= \sigma_z = \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1].
\end{align}
$$
