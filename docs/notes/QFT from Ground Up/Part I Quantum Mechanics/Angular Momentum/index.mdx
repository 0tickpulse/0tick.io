# Angular Momentum

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is a fundamental concept that describes the rotational motion of particles.
In the standard model, particles have different types of spin, which can be thought of as intrinsic angular momentum.
Specifically, fermions have half-integer spin (e.g., 1/2, 3/2), while bosons have integer spin (e.g., 0, 1).
This distinction is crucial in quantum field theory, as it determines the statistics that govern the behavior of particles and their interactions.
