# Additional Topic: Philosophical Interpretations

Quantum mechanics is a field that has given rise to various philosophical interpretations.
These interpretations attempt to explain the underlying nature of reality as described by quantum mechanics.

More specifically, quantum mechanics itself is a mathematical framework that describes the behavior of particles at the quantum level.
However, it does not provide a clear picture of what reality is or how we should interpret the results of quantum experiments.
In other words, quantum mechanics describes *how* things behave, but not *why* they behave that way.
To this end, various interpretations have been proposed to provide a more intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics.
Generally, these interpretations pertain to the nature of the state vector, probability, and the process of measurement.

We will also discuss the implications of these interpretations for our understanding of reality.
For example, different interpretations differ on the deterministic nature of the universe, which in turn affects our understanding of causality and free will.
