# Computation Models

The fundamental computational model in computer science is the Turing machine.
This model is a theoretical construct that describes how a machine can manipulate symbols on a tape according to a set of rules.
Despite its simplicity, the Turing machine is capable of performing any computation that can be expressed algorithmically.
In this section, we will explore the Turing machine and its significance in the field of computer science.
Specifically, we discuss its capabilities, limitations, and its relationship to other computational models.
