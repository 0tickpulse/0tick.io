# Mathematical Foundations

Our first section on quantum mechanics will introduce the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.
In this chapter, we will introduce the state vector formalism, which is the most fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.

Through this chapter, we shall gradually build up the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics.
At the same time, we will slowly develop our notation to a more abstract and concise form.
This means, for example, we will eventually strip away the arrow on top of a vector: $\va{v} \to \vb{v}$.
Operators will also slowly lose their hats: $\hat{A} \to A$.
