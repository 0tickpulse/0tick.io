# Position and Momentum

In the previous section, we applied the state vector formalism to spin-1/2 particles.
Notably, it has a discrete spectrum, and the state vector is a two-component column vector.

We shall now apply the state vector formalism to the description of the position and momentum of a particle.
We shall see that the position and momentum operators are the generators of translations in space and time, respectively.
Furthermore, we will discuss the canonical commutation relations between the position and momentum operators.

## Position Operator

The position observable has a continuous spectrum; its values can be any real number.
Furthermore, we know that there are three spatial dimensions, so the position operator must be a vector operator.
We assume that the position eigenkets $\ket{\va{r}}$ form a complete basis for the Hilbert space of the particle (an assumption in non-relativistic quantum mechanics).

For a single dimension, the state vector $\ket{\psi}$ can be expanded as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \int \dd{x'} \ket{x'} \braket{x'}{\psi}
\end{equation}
$$

In three dimensions, the state vector $\ket{\psi}$ can be expanded as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \int \dd[3]{\va{r}'} \ket{\va{r}'} \braket{\va{r}'}{\psi}
\end{equation}
$$

In this case, then, $\ket{\va{r}'}$ is an eigenket of all three components of the position operator.
From what we know about commutators, this means that the position operators in different directions have a commutator of zero:

$$
\begin{equation}
\comm{x_i}{x_j} = 0
\end{equation}
$$
