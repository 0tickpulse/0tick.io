# Lagrangian Noether's Theorem ❤️

In the previous sections, we have seen how the Lagrangian formalism can be used to describe the dynamics of a system.
In this section, we will see how the Lagrangian can be used to derive conservation laws for a system.
In particular, we will see how symmetries of the Lagrangian lead to conservation laws in the form of **Noether's theorem**.

There are a few reasons why this is important and interesting:

1. As Schneider puts it, it is "one of the most beautiful love stories in the universe".
    (Therefore, it also makes for a good pick-up line.)
2. It is also one example of a profound connection in physics that is just not apparent from Newton's laws.
3. This concept is also exceedingly important in quantum field theory, where symmetries play a central role in the formulation of the theory.
    The standard model is based around the $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ symmetry group, and the conservation laws that arise from this symmetry are the conservation of electric charge, weak isospin, and color charge.

## Symmetries and Conservation Laws

There is a deep connection between symmetries of a system and conservation laws.
In particular, if a system has a symmetry, then there is a corresponding conservation law.

Here are a few examples of symmetries and their corresponding conservation laws:

| <span className="blue">Rotation symmetry</span> | <span className="pink">Conservation of angular momentum $\va{L}$</span> |

Here are some more advanced examples:

| <span className="blue">Scale symmetry</span> | <span className="pink">Conservation of dilatation current $D^\mu$</span> |

In the context of the Lagrangian formalism, we can derive these conservation laws using Noether's theorem.

Formally, Noether's theorem mathematically states:

<Boxed>
**Noether's Theorem**: If a system is defined by a Lagrangian $L(q, \dot{q}, t)$, if, under a continuous infinitesimal transformation $q \to q + \epsilon \delta q$, the Lagrangian changes as $L \to L + \epsilon \dv{F}{t}$, then there exists a conserved quantity $C$:

$$
\begin{equation}
C = \sum_i \pdv{F}{\dot{q}_i} \delta q_i + \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{q}_i} \dot{q}_i - L) \delta t - F
\end{equation}
$$
