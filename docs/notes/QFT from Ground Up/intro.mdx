# Quantum Field Theory from the Ground Up

Modern particle physics posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not particles but fields.
Instead, particles are merely excitations of these fields.
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines quantum mechanics and special relativity to study these fields and their interactions.
Our current understanding of the universe is based on the Standard Model of particle physics, which is a quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces.
It is defined by the Standard Model Lagrangian:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^a F^{a\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi} (i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m) \psi + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs}}
\end{equation}
$$

We classify particles into two categories: fermions and bosons.
Fermions are, in essence, matter particles, while bosons are force carriers.
Fermions are spin-1/2 particles, while bosons are spin-0 or spin-1 particles. The spin-0 boson is the Higgs boson.
Spin-1/2 particles are described by spinors, spin-0 by scalars, and spin-1 by vectors.

In quantum field theory, all particles are treated as excitations of their respective fields.
For example, electrons are excitations of the electron field, while photons are excitations of the electromagnetic field.
The Lagrangian density describes the dynamics of these fields and their interactions.
Additionally, the fields interact with each other through the exchange of force-carrying particles, which are also excitations of their respective fields.

To study quantum field theory, we need to have a solid understanding of three key concepts:

1. **Quantum Mechanics**: In the early 20th century, various physical phenomena could not be explained by classical physics.
    Quantum mechanics emerged as a new framework to describe the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels.
    Understanding quantum mechanics is essential for grasping the principles of quantum field theory because QFT builds upon the foundations of quantum mechanics.

2. **Special Relativity**: Special relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, describes the behavior of objects moving at high speeds, close to the speed of light.
    Fundamentally, its core postulate leads to the Lorentz transformation, which relates the space and time coordinates of two observers in relative motion.
    QFT is a relativistic theory, meaning it incorporates the principles of special relativity into its framework.

3. **Classical Field Theory**: Classical field theory describes the behavior of classical fields, such as electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and scalar fields.
    Classical field theory ensures that the principle of locality is satisfied, meaning that interactions occur at a single point in space and time.
    For example, Newtonian gravity does not satisfy locality, as it acts instantaneously at a distance. This is why a field theory of gravity is required (general relativity).
    Once we attempt to make quantum mechanics relativistic, we realize that we need to use a field-theoretic approach to describe particles and their interactions.

Quantum field theory can be thought of as a method to ensure quantum mechanics adheres to both the principles of special relativity and locality.
In modern physics, quantum field theory is mostly used for two purposes:

1. **Particle Physics**: QFT is the theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental particles and their interactions.
    The Standard Model of particle physics is a quantum field theory that describes all known fundamental interactions except for gravity.
2. **Condensed Matter Physics**: QFT is also used to describe many-body systems in condensed matter physics.
    While particle physics focuses on a single particle or a few particles, condensed matter physics deals with systems containing a large number of particles.
    Instead of describing each particle individually, we use statistics to describe the collective behavior of the system.

In addition to the physics, quantum field theory also has a very rich mathematical structure.
This includes concepts from group theory, topology, and differential geometry.
We will encounter many of these concepts throughout the course, such as group representations, Lie algebras, fiber bundles, Clifford algebras, and much more.
As such, I have included a section purely dedicated to mathematical concepts.
This section will be a reference for the mathematical concepts we will encounter throughout the course.

I will also assume that the reader understands basic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, along with some other concepts.

Below are some "cards" that summarizes key concepts.

### Lagrangian Mechanics

:::info Lagrangian mechanics

Lagrangian mechanics is a reformulation of classical mechanics that uses the principle of least action to derive the equations of motion for a system.

In simple systems, the Lagrangian is given by the difference between the kinetic and potential energy of the system:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, \dot{x}, t) = T - V
\end{equation}
$$

The principle of stationary action states that the path taken by a system between two points in configuration space is the one that has a stationary action.
This is similar to how functions have stationary points (extrema), except instead of points, we have paths.
It can be shown that the principle leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{L}{x} - \dv{t} \qty(\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}) = 0
\end{equation}
$$

We can relate this to Newton's laws by considering the following:

1. In simple systems, the kinetic energy only depends on the velocity of the system, while the potential energy only depends on the position.
    Thus, $\pdv{L}{x}$ is just $\pdv{V}{x}$, which is the force acting on the system.
2. The term $\pdv{L}{\dot{x}}$ is just $\pdv{T}{\dot{x}} = \pdv{x} \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 = m \dot{x}$, which is the momentum of the system.
3. So we can rewrite the Euler-Lagrange equations as

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    F(x) - \dv{t} \qty(m \dot{x}) = 0,
    \end{equation}
    $$

    which is just Newton's second law.

### Hamiltonian Mechanics

:::info Hamiltonian mechanics

Hamiltonian mechanics is another reformulation of classical mechanics that uses the Hamiltonian function to derive the equations of motion for a system.

The Hamiltonian is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
H(x, p, t) = p \dot{x} - L(x, \dot{x}, t)
\end{equation}
$$

The momentum is no longer defined as $p = m \dot{x}$, but rather as the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocity:

$$
\begin{equation}
p = \pdv{L}{\dot{x}}.
\end{equation}
$$

In simple systems, the Hamiltonian is given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the system:

$$
\begin{equation}
H(x, p, t) = T + V
\end{equation}
$$

The equations of motion are given by Hamilton's equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\dot{x} &= \pdv{H}{p} \\
\dot{p} &= -\pdv{H}{x}
\end{align}
$$

A Poisson bracket of two functions $f$ and $g$ is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\pb{f}{g} = \sum_i \qty(\pdv{f}{q_i} \pdv{g}{p_i} - \pdv{f}{p_i} \pdv{g}{q_i}).
\end{equation}
$$

When the Lagrangian is differentiated with respect to some quantity, we get another quantity:

$$
\begin{align}
\pdv{L}{t} &= -\pdv{H}{x} \\
\pdv{L}{x} &= \pdv{p}{t} \\
\pdv{L}{p} &= \pdv{x}{t} \\
\pdv{L}{\theta} &= \pdv{(\text{Angular momentum})}{t}
\end{align}
$$

We say that the quantity on the right is the generator of the quantity on the left.
For example, looking at the first line, $H$ is the generator of differentiating by $t$—time translations.
$p$ is the generator of spatial translations, and $x$ is the generator of momentum translations.

### Electricity and Magnetism

:::info Electricity and Magnetism

The basic equations of electromagnetism are given by Maxwell's equations, which, in SI units, are given by

$$
\begin{align}
\div{\vb{E}} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\div{\vb{B}} &= 0 \\
\curl{\vb{E}} &= -\pdv{\vb{B}}{t} \\
\curl{\vb{B}} &= \mu_0 \vb{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \pdv{\vb{E}}{t}
\end{align}
$$

where $\vb{E}$ is the electric field, $\vb{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\rho$ is the charge density, and $\vb{J}$ is the current density.

The first law is Gauss's law, which states that the divergence of the electric field is proportional to the charge density.
It can equivalently be written in terms of the electric potential $\phi$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
-\laplacian{\phi} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
\end{equation}
$$

The second law is Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero.
This means that there are no "sources" or "sinks" of magnetic field lines, and thus magnetic monopoles do not exist.

The third law is Faraday's law of induction, which states that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field.
This is important because it means that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field.

The fourth law is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the magnetic field to the electric current and the rate of change of the electric field.

The force on a charged particle in an electric and magnetic field is given by the Lorentz force law:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{F} = q \qty(\vb{E} + \vb{v} \cross \vb{B}),
\end{equation}
$$

Lastly, from Maxwell's equations, we can derive the wave equation for electromagnetic waves (I won't derive it here, but just take the curl of Faraday's law in a vacuum):

$$
\begin{equation}
\laplacian{\vb{E}} - \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv[2]{\vb{E}}{t} = 0,
\end{equation}
$$

and similarly for the magnetic field.
$c$ is defined as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}}$, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.
