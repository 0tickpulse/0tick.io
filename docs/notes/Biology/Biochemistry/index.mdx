# Biochemistry

Before studying larger biological systems, it is essential to understand the chemical foundations that underpin life processes. Living organisms are fundamentally made up of molecules that interact through chemical reactions, and these interactions are governed by the principles of physics and chemistry. As such, understanding these foundations provides a much-needed foundation for studying the life sciences.
Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological molecules and their interactions within living organisms.
