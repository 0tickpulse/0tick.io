# Introduction to Biomolecules

When we begin the scientific study of life, we are immediately confronted with the complexity of biological systems.
Fundamentally, life is made of molecules, and we will dedicate a large portion of time to studying these molecules.
Biomolecules are the building blocks of life, and they are responsible for the structure and function of all living organisms.
In this section, we will introduce the major classes of biomolecules and their roles in biological systems.
