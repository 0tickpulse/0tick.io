# Mathematical Methods for Theoretical Physics

In this section, we will review the mathematical methods needed for theoretical physics.
This includes topics such as linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, complex analysis, group theory, differential geometry, topology, and more.
We will also cover some more advanced topics such as functional analysis, distribution theory, and category theory
Interestingly, much of the mathematics here revolve around vector spaces. Therefore, we will start with a review of vector spaces and linear algebra.

For this section we will follow *Mathematical Physics: A Modern Introduction to Its Foundations* by Sadri Hassani, which is an excellent book that covers all the necessary mathematics needed for theoretical physics.

As did Hassani, I have included a table for the various symbols used in this section.
Some of them might differ from the book.
