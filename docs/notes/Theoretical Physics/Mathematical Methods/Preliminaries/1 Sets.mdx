# Sets and Maps

Mathematics has always been about understanding structures and patterns.
Ancient Greek mathematicians studied geometry and number theory, while modern mathematicians explore abstract algebra, topology, and category theory.
However, for the longest time, there was no formal framework to study these structures and patterns.
In other words, we do not have a formal language to describe what a "structure" or "pattern" is.
This changed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the development of set theory by Georg Cantor and others.
Set theory provides a formal framework to study collections of objects, which we call sets.

As we are about to study heavily abstract topics in theoretical physics --- think fiber bundles, Lie groups, measure theory, and functional analysis --- it is essential to have a solid understanding of set theory.

Also, the section and theorem numbering follows Hassani's book.
You can consider this set of notes to be my annotated version, or a different perspective, of the book.

## 1.1 Sets

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.
A **singleton** is a set with exactly one element, and an **empty set** is a set with no elements, denoted by $\emptyset$.
It is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\emptyset := \{ x | x \neq x \}.
\end{equation}
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A$ is a **subset** of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equal**, denoted by $A = B$, if they have the same elements, i.e., $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
Set operations include:

$$
\begin{align}
A \cup B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \quad \text{(union)} \\
A \cap B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \quad \text{(intersection)} \\
A \setminus B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \} \quad \text{(set difference)} \\
\complement A &:= \{ x | x \notin A \} \quad \text{(complement)}
\end{align}
$$

In a specific theory, we often have a **universal set** $U$ that contains all the objects under consideration.
The **power set** of a set $A$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$.
By Cantor's theorem, the power set of a set $A$ has a strictly greater cardinality than $A$ itself.
For example, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite, while its power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountably infinite.

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$:

$$
\begin{equation}
A \times B := \{ (a, b) | a \in A, b \in B \}.
\end{equation}
$$

:::definition Definition 1.1.1 (relation, equivalence relation, equivalence class)

A **relation** $\triangleright$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$.
If $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$ by $\triangleright$, denoted by $a \triangleright b$.

An **equivalence relation** on a set $A$ is a relation $\sim$ on $A$ that satisfies the following properties for all $a, b, c \in A$:

1. **Reflexivity**: $a \sim a$.
2. **Symmetry**: If $a \sim b$, then $b \sim a$.
3. **Transitivity**: If $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $a \sim c$.

The **equivalence class** of an element $a \in A$ under the equivalence relation $\sim$ is the set of all elements in $A$ that are related to $a$:

$$
\begin{equation}
[a] := \{ x \in A | x \sim a \}.
\end{equation}
$$

:::

:::proposition Proposition 1.1.2 (disjoint or equal equivalence classes)

If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $A$, then $\forall a, b \in A$, either $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$ or $[a] = [b]$.

---

*Proof.* Let $c$ be an element in $[a]$. Obviously, either $c \in [b]$ or $c \notin [b]$.
Let's consider the two cases.

First, if $c \in [b]$, then by definition of equivalence class, $c \sim b$.
Since $c \in [a]$, we also have $c \sim a$, and by symmetry $a \sim c$.
By transitivity, we have $a \sim b$.
Then, for any $x \in [a]$, we have $x \sim a$. By transitivity, $x \sim b$, so $x \in [b]$.
Thus $[a] \subseteq [b]$.
By symmetry of the argument, we also have $[b] \subseteq [a]$.
Therefore, $[a] = [b]$.

Second, we have $c \notin [b]$. For any $x \in [a]$, we have $x \sim a$.
By transitivity, if $x \in [b]$, then $a \sim b$ and thus since $c \sim a$, we have $c \sim b$, which contradicts the assumption that $c \notin [b]$.
Therefore, $x \notin [b]$ for all $x \in [a]$, and thus $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$.

Thus, we have shown that either $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$ or $[a] = [b]$.
$\blacksquare$

:::

:::example Example 1.1.3 (examples of equivalence relations)

There are some examples of relations:

- The equality of real numbers is an equivalence relation.
- Comparison of real numbers (i.e., $<$, $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$) is not an equivalence relation.
- Congruence modulo $n$ on the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is an equivalence relation.
- Similarity of triangles is an equivalence relation.
- In electromagnetism, two vector potentials $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A'}$ are related by a gauge transformation if there exists a scalar function $\chi$ such that $\mathbf{A'} = \mathbf{A} + \nabla \chi$. This relation is an equivalence relation.

:::

:::definition Definition 1.1.4 (partition)

A **partition** of a set $A$ is a collection of non-empty subsets $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of $A$ such that

1. $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = A$,
2. $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$.

:::

In other words, a partition of a set $A$ is a way of dividing $A$ into a collection of smaller sets that do not overlap and together cover the entire set $A$.
For example, the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ can be partitioned into even and odd integers.
In basic calculus, we partition the real line $\mathbb{R}$ into intervals to define the Riemann integral.

There is a deep connection between equivalence relations and partitions.
Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a set $A$.
Then, the set of equivalence classes $\{[a] | a \in A\}$ forms a partition of $A$.
Conversely, given a partition $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of a set $A$, we can define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $A$ by saying that $a \sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ belong to the same subset $A_i$ of the partition.

To put this more concretely, consider an example. Suppose we have $\mathbb{Z}$ and the equivalence relation of congruence modulo $3$.
The equivalence classes are $[0] = \{ \ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \}$, $[1] = \{ \ldots, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots \}$, and $[2] = \{ \ldots, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots \}$.
These equivalence classes form a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$, as they are non-empty, disjoint, and their union is $\mathbb{Z}$.

The collection $\{[a] | a \in A\}$ is called the **quotient set** of $A$ by the equivalence relation $\sim$, denoted by $A / \sim$.

## 1.2 Maps

Now that we have a solid understanding of sets and relations, how do we relate different sets to each other?
One way is through the concept of a **map**.
A **map** $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$, denoted by $f: A \to B$, is a rule that assigns to each element $a \in A$ an element $b \in B$, denoted by $f(a) = b$.
Each element $a \in A$ corresponds to exactly one element $b \in B$, but an element $b \in B$ can correspond to multiple elements in $A$.

Three important terms are:

- The set $A$ is called the **domain** of the map $f$.
- The set $B$ is called the **codomain** of the map $f$.
- If $f(a) = b$, then $b$ is called the **image** of $a$ under $f$, and $a$ is called a **preimage** of $b$.
    We notate the image as $f(A) = \{ f(a) | a \in A \} \subseteq B$, and the preimage as $f^{-1}(B) = \{ a \in A | f(a) \in B \} \subseteq A$.

:::definition Definition 1.2.1 (Function)

If a map's codomain is a set of numbers (e.g., $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{Z}$), then the map is usually called a **function**.

:::

The **identity map** on a set $A$, denoted by $\text{id}_A$, is the map that assigns each element to itself, i.e., $\text{id}_A(a) = a$ for all $a \in A$.

The **graph** of $f$, written as $\Gamma_f$, is the set of ordered pairs $\{(a, f(a)) | a \in A\} \subseteq A \times B$.
In elementary algebra, we often visualize the graph of a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by plotting the points $(x, f(x))$ in the Cartesian plane.

If we have two maps $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$, we can compose them to get a new map $g \circ f: A \to C$, defined by $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a))$ for all $a \in A$.
Function composition is associative, i.e., if we have three maps $f: A \to B$, $g: B \to C$, and $h: C \to D$, then

$$
\begin{equation}
h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f.
\end{equation}
$$

The identity map acts as the identity element for function composition, i.e., for any map $f: A \to B$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
f \circ \text{id}_A = f \quad \text{and} \quad \text{id}_B \circ f = f.
\end{equation}
$$

(These properties make the collection of all sets and maps between them into a **category**, which we will explore in more detail later.)

A map $f: A \to B$ is called **injective** (or one-to-one) if for all $a_1, a_2 \in A$, $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ implies $a_1 = a_2$.
In other words, different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain.
When visualized in the Cartesian plane, an injective function passes the horizontal line test.

A map $f: A \to B$ is called **surjective** (or onto) if for every $b \in B$, there exists at least one $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.
In other words, every element in the codomain has at least one preimage in the domain.
The sine function $f(x) = \sin x$ is not surjective when considered as a map from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, but it is surjective when considered as a map from $\mathbb{R}$ to the interval $[-1, 1]$.

A map $f: A \to B$ is called **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.
A bijective map establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the domain and codomain.
A bijective map has an **inverse** map $f^{-1}: B \to A$, defined by $f^{-1}(b) = a$ if and only if $f(a) = b$.
The inverse map satisfies the properties $f^{-1} \circ f = \text{id}_A$ and $f \circ f^{-1} = \text{id}_B$.

If we consider $f: A \to B$, we can define an equivalence relation $\triangleright$ on $A$ by saying that $a_1 \triangleright a_2$ if and only if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$, where $=$ is another equivalence relation on $B$ (usually the equality relation).
For example, consider the map $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$.
Then, we have $1 \triangleright -1$ because $f(1) = f(-1) = 1$.
This is obviously not a bijective map, as it is not injective.
Generally, for any $x$, $f^{-1}(x)$ can be any element in $[x]$.

To make $f$ bijective, we can restrict the domain to a subset of $A$ that contains exactly one representative from each equivalence class.
For example, if we restrict the domain of $f(x) = x^2$ to $[0, \infty)$, then $f$ becomes bijective.
In fact, for any $f: A \to B$, we can define another map $\tilde{f}: A / \triangleright \to B$ by $\tilde{f}([a]) = f(a)$, known as the **quotient map**.
This map is always injective, as different equivalence classes map to different elements in $B$.
However, it may not be surjective, as some elements in $B$ may not have a preimage in $A$.

:::proposition Proposition 1.2.2 (quotient map bijectivity)

The quotient map $\tilde{f}: A / \triangleright \to f(A)$ is bijective.

---

*Proof.* This is quite obvious from the definition of the quotient map.

We have already established that $\tilde{f}$ is injective.
To show that it is surjective, let $b \in f(A)$.
By definition of the image, there exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.
Then, we have $\tilde{f}([a]) = f(a) = b$.
Thus, every element in $f(A)$ has a preimage in $A / \triangleright$.
Therefore, $\tilde{f}$ is surjective.
$\blacksquare$

---

:::

There are some very important examples of maps and quotient maps:

:::example Example 1.2.3 (sine/cosine and their inverses)

Consider the sine and cosine functions, $f(x) = \sin x$ and $g(x) = \cos x$.
These functions are not bijective when considered as maps from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, but they become bijective when restricted to the interval $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ for sine and $[0, \pi]$ for cosine.
The inverse functions, $\sin^{-1} x$ and $\cos^{-1} x$, are called the arcsine and arccosine functions, respectively.

:::

:::example Example 1.2.4 (canonical projection map and quotient map)

For any set $A$ with equivalence relation $\sim$, the **canonical projection** map $\pi: A \to A / \sim$ is defined by $\pi(a) = [a]$.
This is a very important map, as it allows us to "collapse" the set $A$ into its equivalence classes.
The canonical projection map is always surjective, as every equivalence class has at least one representative in $A$.
However, it may not be injective, as different elements in $A$ may belong to the same equivalence class.
The quotient map $\tilde{\pi}: A / \sim \to A / \sim$ is the identity map, which is obviously bijective.

:::

Also, domains of maps can be Cartesian products of sets.
The dot product is given by $\cdot: \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a real vector space.
A few important examples of maps with Cartesian product domains include:

- A **binary operation** on a set $A$ is a map $*: A \times A \to A$.
    Examples include addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{Z}$.
    Binary operations with certain properties give rise to algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
- A **bilinear map** between two vector spaces $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is a map $B: \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{W} \to \mathbb{F}$ that is linear in each argument.
    Examples include the dot product and the cross product in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
    These form the basis of multilinear algebra and tensor analysis.

## 1.3 Metric Spaces

Another important structure on a set is a **metric**.
Sets themselves do not have any notion of distance or closeness between elements.
To make things physically relevant or even useful at all, we need to endow additional structures to sets.

:::definition Definition 1.3.1 (metric)

A **metric** on a set $M$ is a function $d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following properties for all $x, y, z \in M$:

1. **Non-negativity**: $d(x, y) \geq 0$, and $d(x, y) = 0$ iff $x = y$.
2. **Symmetry**: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
3. **Triangle inequality**: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$.

:::

Sometimes, the non-negativity property does not hold for some metrics, to which case we call them **pseudometrics**.
Our universe is a pseudometric space, as the distance between two points in spacetime can be zero even if they are not the same point (i.e., for lightlike separated points).

Anyways, a set $M$ equipped with a metric $d$ is called a **metric space**, denoted by $(M, d)$.

:::example Example 1.3.2 (examples of metrics)

Examples of metrics include:

- For $M = \mathbb{R}$ or $M = \mathbb{Q}$, the absolute value metric is defined by $d(x, y) = |x - y|$.
- For $M$ to be the surface of a 2-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the great-circle distance metric is defined by $d(x, y) = r \cdot \theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere and $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors from the center of the sphere to points $x$ and $y$.
- For $\mathcal{C}^0(a, b)$ (the set of all continuous functions on the interval $(a, b)$), the metric

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    d(f, g) = \int_a^b |f(x) - g(x)| \dd{x}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    defines a metric space.
- For $\mathcal{C}^0_B(a, b)$, a bounded continuous function space, we can define

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    d(f, g) = \sup_{x \in (a, b)} |f(x) - g(x)|,
    \end{equation}
    $$

    which is called the uniform metric.
- In $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can define the Euclidean metric by

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2},
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$.
- In $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can also define the Manhattan metric by

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|,
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ and $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)$.
    This metric is named after the grid-like street layout of Manhattan, where the distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
    It is used in various applications, including urban planning, robotics, and machine learning.

:::

A **sequence** in a set $M$ is a function $s: \mathbb{N} \to M$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers.
Typically, the value of $s(n)$ is denoted by $s_n$, and the set as $\{s_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$.

:::definition Definition 1.3.3 (Convergent Sequence)

A sequence $\{s_n\}$ in a metric space $(M, d)$ is said to **converge** to a point $s \in M$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, $d(s_n, s) < \epsilon$.

The sequence **converges** to $s$, denoted by $\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = s$ or $s_n \to s$ as $n \to \infty$.

:::

In other words, a sequence converges to a point if the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to that point as $n$ increases.
Unfortunately, we can't readily tell if a sequence converges just by looking at it.
A weaker notion is that of a **Cauchy sequence**.

:::definition Definition 1.3.4 (Cauchy Sequence)

A sequence $\{s_n\}$ in a metric space $(M, d)$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $m, n \geq N$, $d(s_n, s_m) < \epsilon$.

In other words, a Cauchy sequence is a sequence where the terms get arbitrarily close to each other as $n$ increases.

:::

Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, but the converse is not necessarily true.

---

*Proof.* Let $\{s_n\}$ be a convergent sequence in a metric space $(M, d)$ that converges to a point $L \in M$.

This obviously means that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \geq N$, $d(s_n, L) < \epsilon / 2$.
We add a $/ 2$ for convenience; scaling $\epsilon$ by a constant does not change the definition.

Now, recall the triangle inequality property of a metric and apply it to $d(s_n, s_m)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
d(s_n, s_m) \leq d(s_n, L) + d(L, s_m).
\end{equation}
$$

For all $m, n \geq N$, we have $d(s_n, L) < \epsilon / 2$ and $d(L, s_m) < \epsilon / 2$, as it is convergent.
Thus, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
d(s_n, s_m) < \epsilon / 2 + \epsilon / 2 = \epsilon.
\end{equation}
$$

This means that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $m, n \geq N$, $d(s_n, s_m) < \epsilon$.
Thus, all convergent sequences are Cauchy sequences.

Next, we show that not all Cauchy sequences are convergent.
A simple way to prove is by counterexample.
Consider the metric space $(\mathbb{Q}, d)$, where $d(x, y) = |x - y|$ is the absolute value metric.
Consider the sequence $\{s_n\}$ defined by successive approximations of $\pi$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\{s_n\} = \{3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, \ldots\}.
\end{equation}
$$

This sequence is a Cauchy sequence, as for every $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that for all $m, n \geq N$, $|s_n - s_m| < \epsilon$.
However, this sequence does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$, as $\pi$ is not a rational number.
This shows that not all Cauchy sequences are convergent. $\blacksquare$

---

If we want all Cauchy sequences to be convergent, we need to impose an additional condition on the metric space.

:::definition Definition 1.3.5 (Complete Metric Space)

A metric space $(M, d)$ is called **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $M$ converges to a point in $M$.

:::

Any incomplete metric space can be "completed" by adding the limit points of all Cauchy sequences.
For example, the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is not complete, as the sequence $\{3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, \ldots\}$ does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.
However, we can complete $\mathbb{Q}$ by adding the irrational numbers, resulting in the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, which is complete.

## 1.4 Cardinality

Finally, we discuss the concept of **cardinality**, which is a measure of the "size" of a set.
Infinity has always been a tricky concept in mathematics.
The ancient Greeks were aware of the concept of infinity, but they did not have a rigorous way to deal with it.
The modern treatment of infinity began with Georg Cantor in the late 19th century, who developed set theory and introduced the concept of cardinality.
With a formal definition of cardinality and related concepts, we resolve paradoxes such as Zeno's paradox and Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel.

For finite sets, the cardinality is simply the number of elements in the set.
For infinite sets, we need a more sophisticated approach.

A set $A$ is said to be **countably infinite** if there exists a bijective map $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$, where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers.
In other words, a set is countably infinite if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
Examples of countably infinite sets include the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

A set $A$ is said to be **uncountably infinite** if it is infinite, but there does not exist a bijective map $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$.
In other words, a set is uncountably infinite if its elements cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
An example of an uncountably infinite set is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.

We can make a visual demonstration to show that $\mathbb{Q}$ has a bijection with $\mathbb{N}$. Let's create an infinite matrix, where the rows and columns are indexed by natural numbers, and the entry at row $i$ and column $j$ is the rational number $\frac{i}{j}$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\mqty[
\frac{1}{1} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{4} & \cdots \\
\frac{2}{1} & \frac{2}{2} & \frac{2}{3} & \frac{2}{4} & \cdots \\
\frac{3}{1} & \frac{3}{2} & \frac{3}{3} & \frac{3}{4} & \cdots \\
\frac{4}{1} & \frac{4}{2} & \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{4} & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
]
\end{equation}
$$

Notice that if we traverse the matrix in a diagonal manner, we can list all the rational numbers.
We can start from the top-left corner and move diagonally down to the right, then move to the next diagonal and repeat the process.
This way, we can list all the rational numbers in a sequence, showing that $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite.
