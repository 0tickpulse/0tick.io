## 1.1

Show that the number of subsets of a set containing $n$ elements is $2^n$.

</summary>

There are a few ways to show this.
One way is to use a combinatorial argument. In a set $A$ with $n$ elements, each element can either be included in a subset or not.
Thus, for each element, there are two choices: to include it or not.
Since there are $n$ elements, the total number of subsets is given by multiplying the number of choices for each element, which is $2^n$. $\blacksquare$

Another way to show this is by using induction.

**Base Case**: For $n = 0$, the set is empty, and there is only one subset, which is the empty set itself. Thus, the number of subsets is $2^0 = 1$.
**Inductive Step**: Assume that for a set with $k$ elements, the number of subsets is $2^k$.
Now, consider a set with $k + 1$ elements. We can think of this set as the union of a set with $k$ elements and an additional element.
The subsets of this new set can be divided into two categories: those that do not include the additional element and those that do.
The number of subsets that do not include the additional element is equal to the number of subsets of the original set with $k$ elements, which is $2^k$ by the inductive hypothesis.
The number of subsets that include the additional element is also equal to the number of subsets of the original set with $k$ elements, which is again $2^k$.
Thus, the total number of subsets for the set with $k + 1$ elements is $2^k + 2^k = 2 \cdot 2^k = 2^{k + 1}$.

By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that the number of subsets of a set containing $n$ elements is $2^n$ for all non-negative integers $n$. $\blacksquare$

## 1.2

Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be sets in a universal set $U$. Show that:

1. $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$ implies $A \subset C$.
2. $A \subset B$ iff $A \cap B = A$ iff $A \cup B = B$.
3. $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$ implies $(A \cup B) \subset C$.
4. $A \cup B = (A \cap B) \cup (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$.

*Hint*: To show the equality of two sets, show that each set is a subset of the other.

</summary>

Let's prove each part step by step.

1. Assume $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$.

    The former means that for every element $x \in A$, we have $x \in B$.
    The latter means that for every element $y \in B$, we have $y \in C$.
    Combining these two statements, we see that for every element $x \in A$, we have $x \in B$ and thus $x \in C$.
    Therefore, $A \subset C$. $\blacksquare$

2. We will prove the equivalence in two parts.

    - ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $A \subset B$.
        This means that for every element $x \in A$, we have $x \in B$.
        So $A$ is a subset of $B$. Moreover, there are no elements in $A$ that are not in $B$, so $A \cap B = A$.

        Also, since every element of $A$ is in $B$, the union $A \cup B$ is just $B$ itself, so $A \cup B = B$.
    - ($\Leftarrow$) Assume $A \cap B = A$.
        This means that every element in $A$ is also in $B$, so $A \subset B$.

        Similarly, assume $A \cup B = B$.
        This means that every element in $A$ is also in $B$, so $A \subset B$.

    Therefore, we have shown in both directions that $A \subset B$ iff $A \cap B = A$ iff $A \cup B = B$. $\blacksquare$

    It is insightful to draw a Venn diagram to visualize this.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR;
        subgraph B
            subgraph A
                A1((x))
                A2((y))
                A3((z))
            end
        end
    ```

3. Assume $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$.

    We want to show that $(A \cup B) \subset C$.
    From the previous part, we know that $A \subset B$ implies $A \cup B = B$.
    Since $B \subset C$, we have $A \cup B = B \subset C$.
    Therefore, $(A \cup B) \subset C$. $\blacksquare$

4. We will prove the equality by showing that each side is a subset of the other.
