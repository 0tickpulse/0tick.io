# Sets

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right.
A **singleton** is a set with exactly one element, and an **empty set** is a set with no elements, denoted by $\emptyset$.
It is defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
\emptyset := \{ x | x \neq x \}.
\end{equation}
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A$ is a **subset** of $B$, denoted by $A \subseteq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equal**, denoted by $A = B$, if they have the same elements, i.e., $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
Set operations include:

$$
\begin{align}
A \cup B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \quad \text{(union)} \\
A \cap B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \quad \text{(intersection)} \\
A \setminus B &:= \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \} \quad \text{(set difference)} \\
\complement A &:= \{ x | x \notin A \} \quad \text{(complement)}
\end{align}
$$

In a specific theory, we often have a **universal set** $U$ that contains all the objects under consideration.
The **power set** of a set $A$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$.
By Cantor's theorem, the power set of a set $A$ has a strictly greater cardinality than $A$ itself.
For example, the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite, while its power set $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is uncountably infinite.

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$:

$$
\begin{equation}
A \times B := \{ (a, b) | a \in A, b \in B \}.
\end{equation}
$$

**Definition 1.1.1** (Relation) A **relation** $\triangleright$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$.
If $(a, b) \in R$, we say that $a$ is related to $b$ by $\triangleright$, denoted by $a \triangleright b$.

An **equivalence relation** on a set $A$ is a relation $\sim$ on $A$ that satisfies the following properties for all $a, b, c \in A$:

1. **Reflexivity**: $a \sim a$.
2. **Symmetry**: If $a \sim b$, then $b \sim a$.
3. **Transitivity**: If $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $a \sim c$.

The **equivalence class** of an element $a \in A$ under the equivalence relation $\sim$ is the set of all elements in $A$ that are related to $a$:

$$
\begin{equation}
[a] := \{ x \in A | x \sim a \}.
\end{equation}
$$

**Proposition 1.1.2** If $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $A$, then $\forall a, b \in A$, either $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$ or $[a] = [b]$.

---

*Proof.* Let $c$ be an element in $[a]$. Obviously, either $c \in [b]$ or $c \notin [b]$.
Let's consider the two cases.

First, if $c \in [b]$, then by definition of equivalence class, $c \sim b$.
Since $c \in [a]$, we also have $c \sim a$, and by symmetry $a \sim c$.
By transitivity, we have $a \sim b$.
Then, for any $x \in [a]$, we have $x \sim a$. By transitivity, $x \sim b$, so $x \in [b]$.
Thus $[a] \subseteq [b]$.
By symmetry of the argument, we also have $[b] \subseteq [a]$.
Therefore, $[a] = [b]$.

Second, we have $c \notin [b]$. For any $x \in [a]$, we have $x \sim a$.
By transitivity, if $x \in [b]$, then $a \sim b$ and thus since $c \sim a$, we have $c \sim b$, which contradicts the assumption that $c \notin [b]$.
Therefore, $x \notin [b]$ for all $x \in [a]$, and thus $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$.

Thus, we have shown that either $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$ or $[a] = [b]$.

There are some examples of relations:

- The equality of real numbers is an equivalence relation.
- Comparison of real numbers (i.e., $<$, $>$, $\leq$, $\geq$) is not an equivalence relation.
- Congruence modulo $n$ on the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is an equivalence relation.
- Similarity of triangles is an equivalence relation.
- In electromagnetism, two vector potentials $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A'}$ are related by a gauge transformation if there exists a scalar function $\chi$ such that $\mathbf{A'} = \mathbf{A} + \nabla \chi$. This relation is an equivalence relation.

**Definition 1.1.4** (Partition) A **partition** of a set $A$ is a collection of non-empty subsets $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of $A$ such that

1. $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = A$,
2. $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$.
