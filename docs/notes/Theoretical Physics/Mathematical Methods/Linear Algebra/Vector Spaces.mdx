# Vector Spaces

A vector space $(V, \mathbb{F})$ is a set $V$ along with a field $\mathbb{F}$, endowed with two operations: vector addition and scalar multiplication. The elements of $V$ are called vectors, and the elements of $\mathbb{F}$ are called scalars.
A set of axioms must be satisfied for $(V, \mathbb{F})$ to be considered a vector space:

1. **Closure under addition**: For any two vectors $u, v \in V$, their sum $u + v$ is also in $V$.
2. **Commutativity of addition**: For any two vectors $u, v \in V$, $u + v = v + u$.
3. **Associativity of addition**: For any three vectors $u, v, w \in V$, $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$.
4. **Existence of additive identity**: There exists a vector $0 \in V$ such that for any vector $v \in V$, $v + 0 = v$.
5. **Existence of additive inverse**: For every vector $v \in V$, there exists a vector $-v \in V$ such that $v + (-v) = 0$.
6. **Closure under scalar multiplication**: For any scalar $a \in \mathbb{F}$ and any vector $v \in V$, the product $a \cdot v$ is also in $V$.
7. **Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition**: For any scalar $a \in \mathbb{F}$ and any two vectors $u, v \in V$, $a \cdot (u + v) = a \cdot u + a \cdot v$.
8. **Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition**: For any two scalars $a, b \in \mathbb{F}$ and any vector $v \in V$, $(a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v$.
9. **Associativity of scalar multiplication**: For any two scalars $a, b \in \mathbb{F}$ and any vector $v \in V$, $(a \cdot b) \cdot v = a \cdot (b \cdot v)$.
10. **Existence of multiplicative identity**: For any vector $v \in V$, $1 \cdot v = v$, where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in $\mathbb{F}$.

We can summarize the axioms into smaller statements.
In particular, axioms 1-5 state that $(V, +)$ is an abelian group, and axioms 6-10 describe how scalar multiplication interacts with vector addition and field addition.
