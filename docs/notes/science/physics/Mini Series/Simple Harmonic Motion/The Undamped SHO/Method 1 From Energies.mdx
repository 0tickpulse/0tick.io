# Method 1: From Energies

In the previous section, we derived the differential equation that describes the motion of a mass-spring system.
This differential equation is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[2]{x}{t} + \omega_0^2 x = 0 \label{eq:undamped-sho-ode}
\end{equation}
$$

In this section, we will explore the first method to solve this differential equation, which, instead of using this ODE directly, uses the conservation of energy.
