# Electromagnetism Introduction

Electromagnetism: electricity and magnetism, two aspects of the same fundamental interaction.

## Charge

Charge is a property of things, just like mass is.

There are two types of charge: positive and negative. These are arbitrary labels, and could have been called anything.

Two common "units" of charge:

* The Coulomb ($C$) is the SI unit of charge.
* The "elementary charge" ($e$) is the charge of a proton or electron. It is approximately $1.6 \times 10^{-19} C$.

## Electric Force

Electric force is the force between two charged objects. Opposites attract, likes repel.

In 1785, Charles Coulomb discovered that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
This is Coulomb's Law, and it is given by:

$$ F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} $$

Where:

* $F$ is the force between the charges.
* $k$ is Coulomb's constant, approximately $8.99 \times 10^9 N m^2 C^{-2}$.
* $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges.
* $r$ is the distance between the charges.
