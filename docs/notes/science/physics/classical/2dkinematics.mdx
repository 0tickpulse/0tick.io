# Two-Dimensional Kinematics

In two dimensions, the position can no longer be wholly described by a scalar.

Instead, we use a vector to describe the position of an object in two dimensions.

$$
\va{r} = x\vu{i} + y\vu{j}
$$

Where $\vu{i}$ and $\vu{j}$ are the unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively.

Therefore, the velocity and acceleration can be derived from the position vector:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \va{v} &= \frac{d\va{r}}\dd{t} = \dv{t}(x\vu{i} + y\vu{j}) = \dv{x}{t}\vu{i} + \dv{y}{t}\vu{j} = v_x\vu{i} + v_y\vu{j} \\
    \va{a} &= \frac{d\va{v}}\dd{t} = \dv{t}(v_x\vu{i} + v_y\vu{j}) = \dv{v_x}{t}\vu{i} + \dv{v_y}{t}\vu{j} = a_x\vu{i} + a_y\vu{j}
\end{align*}
$$

Where $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the x and y components of the velocity, and $a_x$ and $a_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the acceleration.

## Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air.

{(() => {
    return (
        <Mafs
            viewBox={{
                x: [-1, 7],
                y: [-1, 7]
            }}
        >
            <Coordinates.Cartesian />
            {/* Parabolic orbit */}
            <Plot.Parametric
                xy={(t) => {
                    const x = 6 * t;
                    const y = 6 * t - 0.5 * 9.8 * t ** 2;
                    return [x, y];
                }}
                t={[0, 1]}
            />
            {/* Actual orbit */}
            <Plot.Parametric
                xy={(t) => {
                    const x = 5 * t;
                    const y = 5 * t - 0.5 * 9.8 * t ** 2;
                    return [x, y];
                }}
                t={[0, 1]}
            />

            {/* Initial velocity vector */}
            <Vector
                tail={[0, 0]}
                tip={[1, 1]}
                color={Theme.green}
            />
            <LaTeX
                tex="v_0"
                at={lineLabel([0, 0], [1, 1], "right")}
            />
        </Mafs>
    )
})()}

The graph above shows the trajectory of a projectile in two dimensions.
Two paths are shown: the predicted parabolic path and the actual path.

Factors affecting the actual orbit include:

- Air resistance, where $F_{\text{air}} = -bv^2\unitvec{v}$, where $b$ is the drag coefficient, $v$ is the velocity, and $\unitvec{v}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the velocity.
- The Coriolis effect, where the Earth's rotation causes the path of the projectile to curve.
- The Magnus effect, where the spin of the projectile causes it to curve.

Usually in projectile motion, we ignore every factor except for gravity.
