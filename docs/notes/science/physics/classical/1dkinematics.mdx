# One-Dimensional Kinematics

One-dimensional kinematics is the study of motion in one dimension.

## Kinematics vs Dynamics

Kinematics studies how objects move, considering the various trajectories and velocities.

On the other hand, dynamics studies the causes of motion, the forces that cause objects to move.

## Position

Position is the location of an object in space. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

Usually, position is denoted as a function of time $\vec{r}(t)$, where $t$ is time.
In one-dimensional kinematics, the position can be written as $x(t)\hat{\vec{i}}$. Here, $\hat{\vec{i}}$ is the unit vector in the direction of motion.

    const x = useMovablePoint([2, 0], { constrain: ([x, y]) => [x, 0] });

## Displacement

Displacement is the change in position of an object, or $\Delta \vec{r}$. It is also a vector quantity.
Displacement can be expressed as follows:

$$
\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}(t_2) - \vec{r}(t_1)
$$

In one-dimensional kinematics, the displacement can be written as:

$$
\Delta \vec{r} = x(t_2)\hat{\vec{i}} - x(t_1)\hat{\vec{i}} \equiv \Delta x\hat{\vec{i}}
$$

## Velocity

Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. It is a vector quantity.
The SI unit of velocity is meters per second ($\text{ms}^{-1}$).

The average velocity, which is the average rate of change of position, is given by:

$$
\vec{v}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{r}}{\Delta t}
$$

In one-dimensional kinematics, the average velocity can be written as:

$$
v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
$$

<DerivativeFromLimits yvar="x" xvar="t" />

The instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific point in time. It is the limit of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero:

$$
v = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$

The vector form of velocity is:

$$
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
$$

And in one-dimensional kinematics:

$$
\vec{v} = \frac{d}{dt}(x\hat{\vec{i}}) = \frac{dx}{dt}\hat{\vec{i}}
$$

## Acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It is a vector quantity.
The SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared ($\text{ms}^{-2}$).

The average acceleration, which is the average rate of change of velocity, is given by:

$$
\vec{a}_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
$$

In one-dimensional kinematics, the average acceleration can be written as:

$$
a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v(t + \Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t}
$$

Just like velocity, the instantaneous acceleration is the acceleration at a specific point in time. It is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero:

$$
a = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{v(t + \Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt}
$$

The vector form of acceleration is:

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}
$$

And in one-dimensional kinematics:

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{d}{dt}(v\hat{\vec{i}}) = \frac{dv}{dt}\hat{\vec{i}}
$$

## Constant Acceleration

If acceleration is constant, problems are very easy to solve.

Let $a(t) = a$ where $a$ is a constant.

For a constant slope of $a$, the velocity-time graph is a straight line.
It can move anywhere vertically. Let the initial velocity be $v(0) = v_0$. Sometimes $v_0$ is written as $u$.

{(() => {
    const v0 = useMovablePoint([0, 1], { constrain: ([x, y]) => [0, y] });
    return <Mafs
        viewbox={{

                [5, 0]
            ]}

        <Polygon

                [0, v0.point[1]],
                [5, v0.point[1]],
                [5, v0.point[1] + 2.5]
            ]}
        />
        <LaTeX

    </Mafs>
})()}

Shown above is the velocity-time graph for a constant acceleration.
The displacement of the object is the area under the graph, which can be divided into two parts: $A_1$ and $A_2$.
$x_0$ is the initial position of the object. Changing $x_0$ does not affect the velocity-time graph.

$$
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= x_0 + A_1 + A_2 \\
&= x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\end{align*}
$$

In vector form in one-dimensional kinematics, the displacement can be written as:

$$
\vec{x}(t) = \vec{x}_0 + \vec{v}_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a} t^2
$$

## Example: Vehicles

Imagine a train traveling at a constant velocity of $20 \text{ms}^{-1}$.
Then, imagine a road parallel to the train tracks, with a car stopping at a traffic light.

The moment the traffic light turns green, the train passes the car, and the car starts accelerating at $2 \text{ms}^{-2}$.
At what time does the car catch up to the train?

To solve this problem, first evaluate the position functions for both the train and the car.

For the train, the position function is:

$$
x_{\text{train}}(t) = v_{\text{train}} t
$$

For the car, the position function is:

$$
x_{\text{car}}(t) = \frac{1}{2} a_{\text{car}} t^2
$$

When the car catches up to the train, that means the positions are equal, so the lines on the graph intersect.

    />
    <Plot.OfX
        y={(t) => 20 * t}
    />
    <Plot.OfX
        y={(t) => t ** 2}
    />
</Mafs>

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{\text{car}}(t) &= x_{\text{train}}(t) \\
\frac{1}{2} a_{\text{car}} t^2 &= v_{\text{train}} t \\
t &= \frac{2 v_{\text{train}}}{a_{\text{car}}} \\
&= \frac{2 \times 20 \text{ms}^{-1}}{2 \text{ms}^{-2}} \\
&= 20 \text{s}
\end{align*}
$$

The car catches up to the train at $t = 20 \text{s}$. (Technically the algebra neglected $t = 0$ as a solution, which is the initial position of the car.)

To find out how far the car has traveled, substitute $t = 20$ into the car's position function:

$$
x_{\text{car}}(20) = 20^2 = 400 \text{m}
$$

The car has traveled $400 \text{m}$ when it catches up to the train.

## Non-Constant Acceleration

For non-constant acceleration, the velocity-time graph is not a straight line.

To get the velocity, we need to make use of calculus.

$$
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} \implies v(t) = \int a(t) \, dt
$$

This is an antiderivative, which is the reverse of differentiation.
For example, if $a(t) = bt^2$ where $b$ is a constant, then:

$$
v(t) = \int bt^2 \, dt = \frac{1}{3} bt^3 + v_0
$$

Consider an acceleration-time graph. The area under the graph is the velocity.
The area is thought of as a sum of rectangles, each with a width of $dt$ and a height of $a(t)$.
To find the area, notice that a small change in time $dt$ incurs a small change in area, which is a rectangle and as such can be calculated as $a(t) dt$.

    const k = 3

                    points={[
                        [i / 2, 0],
                        [i / 2, f(i / 2)],
                        [(i + 1) / 2, f(i / 2)],

            ))}
        </Mafs>
    )
})()}

$$
d\text{Area} = dv = a(t) \, dt \implies \frac{dv}{dt} = a(t)
$$

And therefore,

$$
\int_{t_i}^{t} a(t) \, dt = v(t) + C
$$

When $t = t_i$, the area from $t_i$ to $t$ is 0, so $C = -v(t_i)$.
Hence,

$$
\int_{t_i}^{t} a(t) \, dt = v(t) - v(t_i)
$$

This is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

To find the position function of the car, we need to integrate the acceleration function.

For $0 < t \leq t_1$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    v_{\text{c}}(t) &= \int 0 \, dt = v_{\text{c}, 0} = 20 \text{ms}^{-1} \\
    x_{\text{c}}(t) &= \int v_{\text{c}}(t) \, dt = v_{\text{c}, 0} t = 20t
\end{align*}
$$

For $t_1 \leq t < t_2$, it's a bit more complicated.

Beforehand, notice that $v_{\text{c}}(t_1) = v_{\text{c}, 0}$ because the car only _starts_ braking at $t = t_1$, so at that instant it doesn't change velocity yet.
Firstly, the velocity can be found by constructing an equation through the fundamental theorem of calculus (Note the $t'$ in the integral is a dummy variable):

$$
\begin{align*}
    v_{\text{c}}(t) - v_{\text{c}}(t_1) &= \int_{t_1}^{t} a_{\text{c}}(t') \, dt' \\
    &= \int_{t_1}^{t} k(t' - t_1) \, dt' = \left[ \frac{1}{2} k(t' - t_1)^2 \right]_{t_1}^{t} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} k(t - t_1)^2 \cancel{- \frac{1}{2} k(t_1 - t_1)^2} = \frac{1}{2} k(t - t_1)^2 \\
    \implies v_{\text{c}}(t) &= v_{\text{c}, 0} + \frac{1}{2} k(t - t_1)^2 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Then, the position function can be found by integrating the velocity function:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x_{\text{c}}(t) - x_{\text{c}}(t_1) &= \int_{t_1}^{t} v_{\text{c}}(t') \, dt' \\
    &= \int_{t_1}^{t} \left( v_{\text{c}, 0} + \frac{1}{2} k(t' - t_1)^2 \right) \, dt'
\end{align*}
$$

Let $u = t' - t_1$, then $du = dt'$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x_{\text{c}}(t) - x_{\text{c}}(t_1) &= \int_{0}^{t - t_1} \left( v_{\text{c}, 0} + \frac{1}{2} ku^2 \right) \, du \\
    &= \left[ v_{\text{c}, 0}u + \frac{1}{6} ku^3 \right]_{0}^{t - t_1} \\
    &= \left( v_{\text{c}, 0}(t - t_1) + \frac{1}{6} k(t - t_1)^3 \right) \\
    \implies x_{\text{c}}(t) &= x_{\text{c}}(t_1) + v_{\text{c}, 0}(t - t_1) + \frac{1}{6} k(t - t_1)^3 \\
    &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + v_{\text{c}, 0}(t - t_1) + \frac{1}{6} k(t - t_1)^3
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the position function of the car is:

$$
x_{\text{c}}(t) = \begin{cases}
v_{\text{c}, 0}t & 0 < t \leq t_1 \\
v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + v_{\text{c}, 0}(t - t_1) + \frac{1}{6} k(t - t_1)^3 & t_1 \leq t < t_2
\end{cases}
$$

To find the velocity of the bicycle, we need to find the time at which the car stops.

At $t = 0$, $x_{\text{b}} = -15 \text{m}$. At $t = t_2$, $x_{\text{c}} = x_{\text{b}}$, and $v_{\text{c}}(t_2) = 0$.

Using the previous velocity function:

$$
\begin{align*}
    v_{\text{c}}(t_2) &= v_{\text{c}, 0} + \frac{1}{2} k(t_2 - t_1)^2 = 0 \\
    \implies t_2 &= t_1 + \sqrt{\frac{-2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{k}} \\
    &= 1 \text{s} + \sqrt{\frac{-2 \times 20 \text{ms}^{-1}}{-5 \text{ms}^{-3}}} \\
    &= 3.828 \text{s}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that this implies:

$$
t_2 - t_1 = \sqrt{\frac{-2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{k}}
$$

Therefore, the position at which the car stops is:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x_{\text{c}}(t_2) &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + v_{\text{c}, 0}(t_2 - t_1) + \frac{1}{6} k(t_2 - t_1)^3 \\
    &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + v_{\text{c}, 0}\sqrt{\frac{-2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{k}} + \frac{1}{6} k\left(\frac{-2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{k}\right)^{3/2} \\
    &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + v_{\text{c}, 0}{\color{red} \sqrt{\frac{2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{-k}}} - \frac{1}{6} \cancel{k}{\color{red} \sqrt{\frac{2v_{\text{c}, 0}}{-k}}}\frac{2}{\cancel{k}} \\
    &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}(v_{\text{c}, 0})^{3/2}}{\sqrt{-k}}\left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \\
    &= v_{\text{c}, 0}t_1 + \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}\frac{(v_{\text{c}, 0})^{3/2}}{\sqrt{-k}} \\
    &= (20 \text{ms}^{-1}) (1 \text{s}) + \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3}\frac{(20 \text{ms}^{-1})^{3/2}}{\sqrt{5 \text{ms}^{-3}}} \\
    &= 95.424 \text{m}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $x_{\text{b}} = -15 \text{m}$, we can construct an equation for the bicycle's position:

$$
\begin{align*}
    x_{\text{b}}(t) &= -15 \text{m} + v_{\text{b}}t \\
    x_{\text{b}}(t_2) &= x_{\text{c}}(t_2) \\
    -15 \text{m} + v_{\text{b}}t_2 &= 95.424 \text{m} \\
    v_{\text{b}} &= \frac{95.424 \text{m} + 15 \text{m}}{t_2} \\
    &= \frac{110.424 \text{m}}{3.828 \text{s}} \\
    &= 28.85 \text{ms}^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$

The velocity of the bicycle is $28.85 \text{ms}^{-1}$.
