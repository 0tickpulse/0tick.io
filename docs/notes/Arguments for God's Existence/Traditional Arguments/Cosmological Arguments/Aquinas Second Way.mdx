# Aquinas' Second Way: First Cause

## Formulation

1. Some things are caused.
2. Everything that is caused is caused by something else.
3. An infinite regress of causes is impossible.
4. Therefore, there must be a first cause, an uncaused cause, that is not caused by anything else (God). (2, 3)

This argument is similar to the [First Way](./Aquinas%20First%20Way.mdx), but instead of focusing on motion, it focuses on causation.
This argument falls to the same objections as the First Way, such as the act-potency distinction, eternalism, and pluralism about beings.
