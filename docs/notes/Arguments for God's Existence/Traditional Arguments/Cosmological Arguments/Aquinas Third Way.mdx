# Aquinas' Third Way: Contingency

## Formulation

1. Whatever is contingent could have been different or not existed at all.
2. If everything were contingent, then there would be a time when nothing existed.
3. If there were a time when nothing existed, then nothing would exist now.
4. But things do exist now.
5. Therefore, not everything is contingent. (2, 3)
6. Therefore, there must be a necessary being.
7. This necessary being either derives its necessity from another necessary being, or is necessary in itself.
8. There cannot be an infinite regress of necessary beings.
9. Therefore, there must be a necessary being that is necessary in itself (God). (7, 8)

This is also pretty similar to the [First Way](./Aquinas%20First%20Way.mdx) and the [Second Way](./Aquinas%20Second%20Way.mdx), but instead of focusing on motion or causation, it focuses on contingency.

## Contingency and the The First Premise

The argument is based on the distinction between necessary and contingent beings.
Necessary beings are beings that must exist for logical reasons, and contingent beings are beings that could have been different or not existed at all, and still be logically consistent.

There's one issue in the first premise, and this can be seen by comparing the following two statements:

1. Definition - Contingent beings can fail to exist.
2. Premise 1 - Contingent beings failed to exist at some point.

Being "able" to fail to exist is not the same as actually failing to exist.
The being could have been present eternally, but still be contingent.

An alternative interpretation is that contingent beings have a natural tendency towards decay and non-existence.
The problem is that this still does not imply that they actually failed to exist at some point.

While an object could tend towards decay, it must have certain manifestation conditions in order to decay.
For instance, a glass of water could decay (evaporate), but only given certain conditions, like the pressure difference and temperature.

## Contingency and the Second Premise

The second premise is that if everything were contingent, then there would be a time when nothing existed.
We shall grant the first premise for the sake of argument, and focus on the second premise.

Let $A_0$ be a contingent being that exists at time $t_0$ and stops existing at time $t_1$.
Let $A_1$ be another contingent being that starts existing at time $t_1$ and stops existing at time $t_2$, and so on.

Generally, $A_n$ starts existing at time $t_n$ and stops existing at time $t_{n+1}$.

This scenario fits the first premise: each $A_n$ did not exist at some point.
However, the second premise does not hold, because there is always something that exists at any given time.
There's always some $A_n$ at any time in $[t_1, t_n]$.

In other words, $\forall t \in [t_1, t_n], \exists A_n, A_n \text{ exists at } t$.

<Mafs>
    <Transform translate={[-3.5, 0]}>
        {range(0, 8).map(n => (
            <Fragment key={n}>
                <Point x={n} y={0} />
                <LaTeX tex={"t_" + n} at={[n, 0.3]} />
                {n > 0 && <LaTeX tex={"A_" + (n - 1)} at={[n - 0.5, -0.3]} />}
            </Fragment>
        ))}
        <Line.Segment point1={[0, 0]} point2={[7, 0]} />
    </Transform>
</Mafs>

As such, even if we grant Premise 1 (which is already problematic), Premise 2 does not necessarily follow.
