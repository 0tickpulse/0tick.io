# Samuel Clarke's Cosmological Argument

## Formulation

1. There is a series of dependent beings.
2. Dependent beings either depend on themselves, or depend on another being.
3. Nothing can depend on itself.
4. Therefore, dependent beings depend on another being. (1, 2)
5. There cannot be an infinite regress of dependent beings.
6. Therefore, there must be a necessary being that is not dependent on anything else (God). (4, 5)
