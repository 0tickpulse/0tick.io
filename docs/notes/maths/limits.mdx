# Limits

Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus. They are used to define the derivative and the integral, and are used to define continuity.

In essence, a limit asks the question: "What value does a function approach as it gets closer and closer to a certain point?"

## Notation

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is denoted by:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x)
$$

This is read as "the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$." It asks, "what value does $f(x)$ approach as $x$ gets closer and closer to $a$?"

## Examples

For instance, consider the function $f(x) = \left| \frac{1}{x} \right|$. As $x$ gets closer and closer to 0, $f(x)$ gets larger and larger.
This can also be viewed on a graph:

export const FunctionGraph = () => {
    return (
        <Mafs
            viewBox={{
                x: [-10, 10],
            }}
        >
            <Coordinates.Cartesian />
            <Plot.OfX y={(x) => Math.abs(1 / x)} />
        </Mafs>
    );
};

<FunctionGraph />

Notice how while it is impossible to actually reach 0, the function gets larger and larger as $x$ gets closer and closer to 0. This is why the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 0 is $\infty$.

Written mathematically:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \left| \frac{1}{x} \right| = \infty
$$

## One-Sided Limits

Let's say we want to get the limit of a function. This time, we're not going to get the function itself, but rather just the graph.

export const OSL1 = ({ annotations }) => {
    const fn1 = (x) => -(Math.E ** (-(x + 2)));
    const fn2 = (x) => 5 / (x + 2) - 5;
    const fn1bounded = (x) => {
        if (x < -2) {
            return fn1(x);
        }
        return NaN;
    };
    const fn2bounded = (x) => {
        if (x > -2) {
            return fn2(x);
        }
        return NaN;
    };
    const dfn1_dx = (x) => Math.E ** (-(x + 2));
    return (
        <Mafs
            viewBox={{
                x: [-10, 10],
            }}
        >
            <Coordinates.Cartesian />
            <Plot.OfX y={fn1bounded} />
            <Plot.OfX y={fn2bounded} />
            <Circle center={[-2, -1]} radius={0.15} />
            <Plot.OfY style="dashed" x={(y) => {
                if (y > -1) {
                    return -2;
                }
                return NaN;
            }} />
            {annotations && <>
                <Plot.Parametric t={[-3, -2]} xy={(t) => {
                    let x = t;
                    let y = fn1(x);
                    if (x < -3 || x > -2) {
                        return NaN;
                    }
                    const vel = dfn1_dx(x);
                    const angle = Math.atan(vel);
                    const angle_rotated = Math.PI / 2 - angle;

                    y += 0.5 * Math.sin(angle_rotated);
                    x -= 0.5 * Math.cos(angle_rotated);

                    return [x, y];
                }} />
            </>}
        </Mafs>
    );

}

<OSL1 />

If we try to approach $x = -2$, you see that there's a massive (infinite) gap between the two sides.
And you approach different values depending on which side you're coming from.

This is why we have the concept of one-sided limits.

The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left is denoted by:

$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)
$$

And similarly, the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right is denoted by:

$$
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)
$$

In this case, using the graph alone, we can see that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to -2^-} f(x) &= -1 \\
\lim_{x \to -2^+} f(x) &= \infty
\end{align*}
$$

## Estimating Limits

There are many ways to estimate a limit. In fact, we just approximated one by looking at the graph above.

### Graph Visualization

Graphing the function and seeing what value it approaches as $x$ gets closer and closer to the point in question is a good way to estimate a limit.

#### Example 1

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right)
$$

Before anything, we can try to evaluate the limit by naively plugging in $x = 0$:

$$
\frac{\sin(0)}{0} = \frac{0}{0}
$$

Oh no! We can't divide by 0! This is a problem. However, we can still try to estimate the limit by graphing the function:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [-10, 10],
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX
        y={(x) => {
            if (Math.abs(x) < 0.15) {
                return NaN;
            }
            return Math.sin(x) / x;
        }}
    />
    {/* A circle for the gap at 0 */}
    <Circle center={[0, 1]} radius={0.15} />
</Mafs>

Notice that while there's a gap at $x = 0$, the function seems to approach 1 as $x$ gets closer and closer to 0. This is why:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right) = 1
$$

:::note

This is not exactly why, but it's good enough for now. A better explanation like using the squeeze theorem will be given later.

:::

### Tables

Another way to estimate a limit is by creating a table of values. This is especially useful when the function is not graphable, or you don't have access to a graphing calculator.

#### Example 2

Let's say this table is given:

| $x$    | $3.9$   | $3.99$  | $3.999$ | $4.001$ | $4.01$  | $4.1$   |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $f(x)$ | $11.21$ | $11.92$ | $11.99$ | $12.01$ | $12.08$ | $12.61$ |

We can estimate the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches 4 by looking at the values of $f(x)$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to 4.

Generally, look for these things when constructing or analyzing a table like this:

-   The values chosen for $x$ should get closer and closer to the value in question.
-   The values of $f(x)$ should be getting closer and closer to a single value.
-   If the values of $f(x)$ are getting closer and closer to a single value, then that value is our estimate for the limit.
-   The limit can be two-sided, and that's shown by the values of $f(x)$ getting closer and closer to a single value from both sides.

#### Example 3

| $x$    | $0.9$  | $0.99$ | $0.999$ | $1.001$ | $1.01$ | $1.1$  |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| $g(x)$ | $9.21$ | $9.94$ | $9.99$  | $7.01$  | $7.05$ | $7.66$ |

Let's say we want to find the limit of $g(x)$ as $x$ approaches 1. Looking at the table though, it seems like there's a gap between $(0.999, 9.99)$ and $(1.001, 7.01)$.
This means that there is likely no limit.

However, if we look at the values of $g(x)$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to 1 from the left, we see that the values of $g(x)$ are getting closer and closer to 10.
Likewise, if we look at the values of $g(x)$ as $x$ gets closer and closer to 1 from the right, we see that the values of $g(x)$ are getting closer and closer to 7.

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x) &= 10 \\
\lim_{x \to 1^+} g(x) &= 7
\end{align*}
$$

## General Procedure

For this limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x)
$$

You can apply this general procedure:

1. Try to substitute in $x = a$. If you get a number, then that's probably the limit.
2. If you get $\frac{b}{0}$ where $b \neq 0$, then you probably hit an asymptote.
3. If you get $\frac{0}{0}$, then you got an indeterminate form.
4. If it's indeterminate, try to rewrite the limit by factoring, rationalizing, or using trigonometric identities.
5. If all else fails, try to estimate the limit using a graph or a table.

### Example 4

> The function $f(x)$ is defined as follows:
>
> $$
> f(x) = \frac{\cos(2x)}{\cos(x) + \sin(x)}
> $$
>
> Find the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $-\frac{\pi}{4}$.

Let's first try to substitute in $x = -\frac{\pi}{4}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
f\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) &= \frac{\cos\left(2 \cdot -\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
&= \frac{\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \\
&= \frac{0}{0}
\end{align*}
$$

We got an indeterminate form. This means we should rewrite the limit.
In this case, the numerator, $\cos(2x)$, can be rewritten using the double angle identity:

$$
\cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)
$$

So the limit becomes:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to -\frac{\pi}{4}} f(x) &= \lim_{x \to -\frac{\pi}{4}} \frac{\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)}{\cos(x) + \sin(x)} \\
&= \lim_{x \to -\frac{\pi}{4}} \frac{(\cos(x) - \sin(x)) {\color{Red}(\cos(x) + \sin(x))}}{{\color{Red}\cos(x) + \sin(x)}} \tag{factoring} \\
&= \lim_{x \to -\frac{\pi}{4}} (\cos(x) - \sin(x)) \tag{canceling} \\
&= \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \sqrt{2}
\end{align*}
$$

## Combining Functions

If you have a limit of a function that's a combination of other functions, you can use the limit laws to simplify the limit.

### Sum and Difference

> The limit of sum is the sum of limits.

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \left(f(x) + g(x)\right) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x)
$$

### Products

> The limit of a product is the product of limits.

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \left(f(x) \cdot g(x)\right) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to a} g(x)
$$

### Composition

This is a bit more interesting. Let's say you want to find the limit of $f(g(x))$ as $x$ approaches $a$. This is called a composition of functions, where you first apply $g(x)$ and then apply $f(x)$ to the result.

For this to work, two conditions must be met:

1. A value $L$ must exist such that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L$.
2. The function $f(x)$ must be continuous at $L$.

If these conditions are met, then:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(g(x)) = f\left(\lim_{x \to a} g(x)\right) = f(L)
$$

## Squeeze Theorem

The squeeze theorem is a powerful tool for finding limits. It's especially useful when you have a function that's hard to evaluate directly.

Let's use an analogy: Alice, Bob, and Charlie all have different heights. Bob is taller than Alice, and Charlie is taller than Bob.

Mathematically: $\text{Alice's height} \leq \text{Bob's height} \leq \text{Charlie's height}$.

Let's say we know Alice's height to be $160\text{cm}$ and Charlie's height to also be $160\text{cm}$. Since Bob's height must be between Alice's and Charlie's, we can conclude that Bob's height is also $160\text{cm}$.

This is the essence of the squeeze theorem. If you have a function $f(x)$ that's always between two other functions $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, and the limits of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ are the same, then the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is also the same.

### Example 5

Remember our function $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$? We estimated the limit to be 1 by graphing the function. However, we can also use the squeeze theorem to rigorously prove that the limit is 1.

As we know, trigonomic functions can be modeled by the unit circle. We will use this to visualize this proof.

Firstly, this is the unit circle:

export function UnitCircle({
    showTan = false,
    blueTriangleAdjusted = false,
    showSector = false,
}) {
    const radius = 1;
    const radialPoint = useMovablePoint([Math.PI / 6, Math.sqrt(1 - (Math.PI / 6) ** 2)], {
        constrain: (point) => {
            let angle = Math.atan2(point[1], point[0]);

            // restrict angle to between -60 and 60 degrees
            if (angle < -Math.PI / 3) {
                angle = -Math.PI / 3;
            } else if (angle > Math.PI / 3) {
                angle = Math.PI / 3;
            }

            const snap = Math.PI / 180;
            const roundedAngle = Math.round(angle / snap) * snap;
            return vec.rotate([radius, 0], roundedAngle);
        },
    });
    const angle = Math.atan2(radialPoint.point[1], radialPoint.point[0]);
    /**
     * Basically e^(i * angle)
     */
    function rotatedPoint(angle, radius = 0.2) {
        return [Math.cos(angle) * radius, Math.sin(angle) * radius];
    }
    const labelOffset = Math.cos(angle) > 0 ? 0.25 : -0.25;
    return (

    );

}

<UnitCircle />

The function $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ can be visualized as the height of the small, blue triangle.
If we extend the line to the right and draw a line from the right to the top, we get a new triangle.

<UnitCircle showTan />

The tangent of the angle would be the opposite over the adjacent, which is $\frac{h}{1}$.
Therefore, the height of the triangle is $\tan(\theta)$.

Now we are going to adjust our blue triangle to touch the unit circle on the right.

<UnitCircle showTan blueTriangleAdjusted />


With this in mind, simply looking at the unit circle, we can see that the red triangle is bigger than the blue triangle.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Area of blue triangle} &\leq \text{Area of red triangle} \\
\frac{1}{2} \left|\sin(\theta)\right| &\leq \frac{1}{2} \left|\tan(\theta)\right| \\
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, let's consider the area of the unit circle sector.

<UnitCircle blueTriangleAdjusted showSector />

The area of the sector can be expressed as a fraction of the area of the whole circle:

$$
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \cdot \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
$$

And looking at the unit circle, we can see that the area of the sector is bigger than our original blue triangle.

$$
\frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{1}{2} \left|\tan(\theta)\right|
$$

Combining the two inequalities and performing some algebraic manipulation, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} \left|\sin(\theta)\right| &\leq \frac{1}{2} \left|\theta\right| &&\leq \frac{1}{2} \left|\tan(\theta)\right| \\
\left|\sin(\theta)\right| &\leq \left|\theta\right| &&\leq \left|\tan(\theta)\right| \tag{Multiplying by 2} \\
\left|\sin(\theta)\right| &\leq \left|\theta\right| &&\leq \frac{\left|\sin(\theta)\right|}{\left|\cos(\theta)\right|} \tag{Since $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$} \\
1 &\leq \frac{\left|\theta\right|}{\left|\sin(\theta)\right|} &&\leq \frac{1}{\left|\cos(\theta)\right|} \tag{Dividing by $\left|\sin(\theta)\right|$} \\
1 &\geq \frac{\left|\sin(\theta)\right|}{\left|\theta\right|} &&\geq \left|\cos(\theta)\right| \tag{Reciprocal}
\end{align*}
$$

Now let's consider our limit again. Since we just want to find out when the angle approaches $0$, we only need to consider the first and fourth quadrants:

* In the first quadrant, $\theta$ is positive and $\sin(\theta)$ is positive.
* In the fourth quadrant, $\theta$ is negative and $\sin(\theta)$ is negative.
* In both quadrants, $\cos(\theta)$ is positive.

As such, we can drop the absolute value signs:

$$
1 \geq \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} \geq \cos(\theta)
$$

Now, let's take the limit of all three sides as $\theta$ approaches $0$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{\theta \to 0} 1 &\geq \lim_{\theta \to 0} \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} &&\geq \lim_{\theta \to 0} \cos(\theta) \\
1 &\geq \lim_{\theta \to 0} \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} &&\geq 1
\end{align*}
$$

And since the limit of $\cos(\theta)$ as $\theta$ approaches $0$ is 1, we can conclude that:

$$
\lim_{\theta \to 0} \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} = 1
$$

That's it. We've proven that the limit of $\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$ as $x$ approaches 0 is 1.

## Formal things

Our definition of limits is simple and intuitive, but it's not rigorous. We can't just say "the function gets closer and closer to a value" - everything in Mathematics needs to be defined precisely.

One way to define limits rigorously is using the $(\varepsilon$-$\delta)$ definition of limits, or the "epsilon-delta" definition of limits.

Graphically, this is what it looks like:

export function EpsilonDeltaGraph() {
    const a = 0; // The point we're approaching
    const f = (x) => 0.5 * x + Math.sin(x) / x;
    const [narrow, setNarrow] = useState(0);
    const x_diff = 1 - narrow / 5;

    const x_min = a - x_diff;
    const x_max = a + x_diff;
    const y_min = f(x_min);
    const y_max = f(x_max);

Suppose we want to find out what this function approaches as $x$ approaches $0$.
We've already done this by looking at values around $x = 0$. In this case, we have a range of $x$ values around $0$ shown by the red lines, and a range of $f(x)$ values around $f(0)$ shown by the blue lines.
The $(\varepsilon$-$\delta)$ definition of limits tells us that if we decrease the size of the range of $x$ values, the size of the range of $f(x)$ values also decreases.

The key point being that the size of the range of $f(x)$ values can decrease however much we want (try moving that slider).

How do $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ fit into this? Take this example:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

Think of any distance from $L$, and call it $\varepsilon$.

What it means in terms of the limit is that you will always be able to find a range of inputs around $a$, some distance $\delta$ away from $a$, such that the outputs of $f(x)$ will always be within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

And this is true for any $\varepsilon$ you choose, no matter how small.

The formal way to write this is:

$$
(\forall \varepsilon > 0)(\exists \delta > 0)(\forall x \in \mathbb{R})(0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon)
$$

Meaning:

- $(\forall \varepsilon > 0)$: For any $\varepsilon$ greater than 0,
- $(\exists \delta > 0)$: there exists a $\delta$ greater than 0,
- $(\forall x \in \mathbb{R})$: such that for any $x$ in the real numbers,
- $(0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon)$: if $x$ is within $\delta$ of $a$, then $f(x)$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.
