# Differential Equations

Differential equations are equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. They are used to model a wide variety of phenomena in the natural and social sciences. We will introduce the basic concepts of differential equations and explore some simple examples.

Previously, in Calculus 1 and 2, we introduced differential equations. Here, we go deeper (hint: DEs go *very* deep).

Calculus 3 (multivariable calculus) is not a prerequisite for this course, but rather a corequisite.
