# Differential Equations

Differential equations are equations that involve an unknown function and its derivatives. They are used to model a wide variety of phenomena in the natural and social sciences. We will introduce the basic concepts of differential equations and explore some simple examples.

Previously, in Calculus 1 and 2, we introduced differential equations. Here, we go deeper (hint: DEs go *very* deep).

Calculus 3 (multivariable calculus) is not a prerequisite for this course, but rather a corequisite.

## Wide-Ranging Applications

Below are some examples of differential equations that are used to model real-world phenomena.
It shows how important differential equations are in the sciences.

1. A simple problem from calculus:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dv{y}{x} = 2x^3
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Problems like this can just be solved by integrating both sides.

2. Newton's Law of Cooling:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dv{T}{t} = -k(T - T_a)
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $T$ is the temperature of an object, $T_a$ is the ambient temperature, and $k$ is a constant.

    This is covered in the [Calculus 1 and 2 notes](/notes/maths/Calculus%201%20and%202/Introduction%20to%20Differential%20Equations).

3. Newton's Law of Gravitation:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dv[2]{x}{t} = -\frac{GM}{x^2}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $x$ is the distance between two objects, $M$ is the mass of one of the objects, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

    This is a second order differential equation, but we can convert it to a first order differential equation by introducing a new variable.

4. Simple harmonic ocsillator; Hooke's Law spring:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    m \dv[2]{x}{t} = -kx
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $m$ is the mass of the object, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium.

5. Damped harmonic oscillator:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    m \dv[2]{x}{t} = -kx - c \dv{x}{t}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $c$ is the damping constant.

6. Simple pendulum:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dv[2]{\theta}{t} = -\frac{g}{L} \sin{\theta}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $L$ is the length of the pendulum.

    This was left unsolved in the [Calculus 1 and 2 notes](/notes/maths/Calculus%201%20and%202/Introduction%20to%20Differential%20Equations).
    We will solve it in this course.

7. Heat equation:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \pdv{u}{t} = k \laplacian{u}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    where $u$ is the temperature of a substance, $t$ is time, and $k$ is a proportionality constant known as the thermal diffusivity.

    The symbol $\laplacian{u}$ is the **Laplacian** of $u$, which is the sum of the second partial derivatives of $u$ with respect to each spatial variable.

- Any mechanics book - mechanics is a field that heavily uses differential equations. If you want to see how DEs are used in practice, and get a **ton** of practice, this is the way to go.
    Generally, for practice, I like to do mechanics problems instead of DE problems.
