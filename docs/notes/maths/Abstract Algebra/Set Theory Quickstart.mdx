# Set Theory Quickstart

Set theory is the true foundation of mathematics; they govern basically everything else.
A set is, in essence, a collection of objects, and set theory is the study of these collections.

For $S$ to be a set, it must be well-defined, i.e., there must be a clear way to determine whether an object $a$ is in the set or not.

There are a few ways to define a set:

1. **Roster notation**: Listing all the elements of the set within curly braces.
   For example, the set of even numbers less than 10 can be written as $S = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}$.
2. **Set-builder notation**: Describing the properties that the elements of the set must satisfy.
   For example, the set of even numbers less than 10 can be written as $S = \{x \mid x \text{ is even and } x < 10\}$.

Sometimes we can use a both notations to define a set. For example, the set of all even natural numbers can be written as $S = \{2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\}$ or $S = \{x \mid x \text{ is even and } x \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

Recall the sets of numbers that we have learned previously. We will now try to define them more formally using this notation:

$$
\begin{alignat}{3}
\mathbb{N} & = \{ n \mid n \text{ is a natural number} \} && = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\} \\
\mathbb{Z} & = \{ n \mid n \text{ is an integer} \} && = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \\
\mathbb{Q} & = \{ r \mid r \text{ is a rational number} \} && = \left\{\frac{a}{b} \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\right\} \\
\mathbb{R} & = \{ r \mid r \text{ is a real number} \} \\
\mathbb{C} & = \{ z \mid z \text{ is a complex number} \} && = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}
\end{alignat}
$$

## Notation and Terminology

Let $E$ be the set of even natural numbers. We can write this as $E = \{2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\}$ or $E = \{x \mid x \text{ is even and } x \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

Since the number $8$ is in the set $E$, we write $8 \in E$. If the number $7$ is not in the set $E$, we write $7 \notin E$.

If we have a set $A$ and a set $B$, and everything in $B$ is also in $A$, we say that $B$ is a subset of $A$, and write $B \subseteq A$.

If, additionally, there is at least one element in $A$ that is not in $B$, i.e. $A \neq B$, we say that $B$ is a proper subset of $A$, and write $B \subset A$.
To prove that $A = B$, we need to show that $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
