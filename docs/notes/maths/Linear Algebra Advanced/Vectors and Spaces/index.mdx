# Vectors and Spaces

The fundamental building blocks of linear algebra are vector spaces.
They are defined by a set of objects called *vectors* and operations that can be performed on these vectors.
We will take a semi-formal approach to defining vectors and vector spaces, and then explore some of the properties and operations that define them.
