# Infinite Series: Part 2

Previously we have laid the foundation for understanding infinite series.
We have seen how to find the sum of an infinite series, and how to determine whether a series converges or diverges using different tests.
Now we will explore some more advanced topics related to infinite series.

## Taylor and Maclaurin Series

The Taylor series is an extremely powerful tool in mathematics, one of the best ways to approximate functions.
It allows for the approximation of a non-polynomial function using a polynomial.
Polynomials are easy to compute, manipulate, differentiate, and integrate, so approximating a function with a polynomial can make it much easier to work with.

To start, consider a function $f(x) = \cos(x)$. Assume this is part of some physics problem, and the existence of a $\cos(x)$ term is making the problem difficult to solve.
Let's say we are interested in the value of $\cos(x)$ near $x = 0$, and we want to approximate it with a degree 2 polynomial (a quadratic function).

Denote the quadratic function as $P_2(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2$. Play around with the sliders below to see how the quadratic function changes as you adjust the coefficients a_0, a_1, and a_2:

{(() => {
    const [a0, setA0] = useState(0);
    const [a1, setA1] = useState(0);
    const [a2, setA2] = useState(0);

    const f = (x) => Math.cos(x);
    const P2 = (x) => a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x ** 2;

                        {`P_2(x) = ${a0.toFixed(2)} + ${a1.toFixed(2)}x + ${a2.toFixed(2)}x^2`}
                    </MathEquation>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
})()}

Consider how the quadratic function $P_2(x)$ changes as you adjust the coefficients $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$.
The goal is to find the coefficients that make $P_2(x)$ as close as possible to $\cos(x)$ near $x = 0$.

First, consider $\cos(x)$ evaluated at $x = 0$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\cos(0) = 1
\end{equation}
$$

We want the **value** of $P_2(x)$ to be the same as $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$.

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                $$
                \cos(0) = 1
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                \begin{split}
                P_2(0) &= a_0 + a_1 \cdot 0 + a_2 \cdot 0^2 \\
                &= a_0
                \end{split}
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                a_0 = 1
                $$
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


Hence, one of the coefficients is already determined. Changing the other coefficients will affect the function but will not change the value of $P_2(0)$.

Next, we want the **slope** of $P_2(x)$ to be the same as the slope of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$.
This ensures that the value of $P_2(x)$ is close to $\cos(x)$ not only at $x = 0$ but also in the neighborhood of $x = 0$; it doesn't drift too far away from $\cos(x)$.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                $$
                \cos(0) = 1
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                \begin{split}
                P_2(0) &= a_0 + a_1 \cdot 0 + a_2 \cdot 0^2 \\
                &= a_0
                \end{split}
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                a_0 = 1
                $$
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                $$
                \dv{x} \cos(x) \Big|_{x = 0} = 0
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                \begin{split}
                \dv{P_2}{x}(0) &= a_1 + 2a_2 \cdot 0 \\
                &= a_1
                \end{split}
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                a_1 = 0
                $$
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Now, both the position and the slope of $P_2(x)$ are locked as the same as $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$.
The only thing left is to make sure the **concavity** of $P_2(x)$ is the same as the concavity of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$.

                \dv{P_2}{x}(0) &= a_1 + 2a_2 \cdot 0 \\
                &= a_1

                \dv[2]{x} \cos(x) \Big|_{x = 0} = -1

            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                \dv[2]{P_2}{x}(0) = 2a_2
                $$
            </td>
            <td>
                $$
                a_2 = -\frac{1}{2}
                $$
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Now we have found the coefficients $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 0$, and $a_2 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The quadratic functoin is then:

$$
\begin{equation}
P_2(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2}x^2
\end{equation}
$$

The quadratic function $P_2(x)$ is a good approximation of $\cos(x)$ near $x = 0$.
As we add more terms to the polynomial, we can get even closer to the original function. For example, we can add two more terms to get a degree 4 polynomial:

$$
\begin{equation}
P_4(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4
\end{equation}
$$

The coefficients $a_3$ and $a_4$ can be determined in a similar way as we did for $P_2(x)$. We take the third and fourth derivatives of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$ and set them equal to the corresponding derivatives of $P_4(x)$ at $x = 0$.
Notice what happens when we take the third derivative of the $x^3$ term in $P_4(x)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\dv[3]{P_4}{x} &= \dv[3]{x} a_3x^3 \\
&= \dv[2]{x} 3a_3 x^2 \\
&= \dv{x} 3 \cdot 2 a_3 x \\
&= 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 a_3 \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Notice we are multiplying $3$ by $2$ by $1$ by $a_3$. This is the same as taking the factorial of $3$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[3]{P_4}{x} = 3! a_3
\end{equation}
$$

Recall that we want this to be equal to the third derivative of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$. Thus:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[3]{P_4}{x} = 3! a_3 = \dv[3]{\cos(x)}{x} \Big|_{x = 0}
\end{equation}
$$

And as such, we can solve for $a_3$:

$$
\begin{equation}
a_3 = \frac{1}{3!} \dv[3]{\cos(x)}{x} \Big|_{x = 0} = 0
\end{equation}
$$

We get a similar result for $a_4$:

$$
\begin{equation}
a_4 = \frac{1}{4!} \dv[4]{\cos(x)}{x} \Big|_{x = 0} = -\frac{1}{4!}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, the degree 4 polynomial approximation of $\cos(x)$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
P_4(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{4!}x^4
\end{equation}
$$

Notice that adding the higher degree term does not affect the previous terms.
For instance, the concavity of $P_4(x)$ is still the same as the concavity of $\cos(x)$ at $x = 0$.

:::note Why?

When we take the derivative of a term with a higher power of $x$, the power of $x$ decreases by one.
The concavity is the second derivative, so the power of $x$ decreases by two - so it doesn't become a constant term.

Recall that we set $x = 0$. As such, if there is an $x$ term in the polynomial, it will be multiplied by zero, and the term will disappear.

:::

Hence, each individual coefficient is the "control" for a specific order derivative of the function.

For a value of $x$ near $0$, the polynomial $P_n(x)$ is a good approximation of $\cos(x)$.
Next, consider approximating $\cos(x)$ with a polynomial near some value $x = \pi/2$.

Then, the polynomial would be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
P_n(x) = a_0 + a_1\qty(x - \frac{\pi}{2}) + a_2\qty(x - \frac{\pi}{2})^2 + \ldots + a_n\qty(x - \frac{\pi}{2})^n
\end{equation}
$$

Instead of $x$, we use $x - \frac{\pi}{2}$ as the variable, such that the point $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ is treated like $0$.
This means that if you plug in $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, things will cancel.

We can keep adding more terms to the polynomial to get a better approximation of $\cos(x)$ near a value of $x$.
The derivatives of $\cos(x)$ follow a pattern of $1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, \ldots$ at $x = 0$. As such, the coefficients of the polynomial will follow a similar pattern:

$$
\begin{equation}
P_n(x) = 1 + 0 \frac{x^1}{1!} - 1 \frac{x^2}{2!} + 0 \frac{x^3}{3!} + 1 \frac{x^4}{4!} - 0 \frac{x^5}{5!} + \ldots
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we can generalize this to any function $f(x)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) = f(0) + \dv{f}{x}(0) x + \frac{1}{2!} \dv[2]{f}{x}(0) x^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \dv[3]{f}{x}(0) x^3 + \ldots
\end{equation}
$$

And to any value $a$:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) = f(a) + \dv{f}{x}(a) (x - a) + \frac{1}{2!} \dv[2]{f}{x}(a) (x - a)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \dv[3]{f}{x}(a) (x - a)^3 + \ldots
\end{equation}
$$

We have just derived the Taylor series for any function $f(x)$ centered at $a$. This can be written in sigma notation as:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \dv[n]{f}{x}(a) (x - a)^n \label{eq:taylor_and_maclaurin_series-sigma}
\end{equation}
$$

When $a = 0$, this is called the Maclaurin series.

What's interesting is that we only need to know the value of the function and its derivatives at a single point $a$ to approximate the function at any other point around it.

    const f = (x) => Math.cos(x) + Math.exp(x) / 2;

### Relationship Between Taylor Series and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

There's a deep connection between the Taylor series and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Recall one interpretation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is that the derivative of the area under a curve is the curve itself.

Consider the area under the curve of a function from $0$ to some variable $a$:

<Mafs viewBox={{ x: [0, 5], y: [0, 5] }}>
    <Plot.Inequality
        y={{
            "<=": (x) => (x > 0 && x < 3) ? (x ** 2) / 3 : 0,
            ">=": 0,
        }}
        color={color("blue")}
    />
    <Coordinates.Cartesian xAxis={{ lines: false, labels: (n) => "" }} yAxis={{ lines: false, labels: (n) => "" }} />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => (x ** 2) / 3} />
    <LaTeX tex={"a"} at={[3, -0.2]} />
</Mafs>

Let the **area** under the curve be $A(a)$.

Next, consider adding a small change to the variable that increases $a$ to $x$:

<Mafs viewBox={{ x: [0, 5], y: [0, 5] }}>
    <Plot.Inequality
        y={{
            "<=": (x) => (x > 0 && x < 3) ? (x ** 2) / 3 : 0,
            ">=": 0,
        }}
        color={color("blue")}
    />
    <Coordinates.Cartesian xAxis={{ lines: false, labels: (n) => "" }} yAxis={{ lines: false, labels: (n) => "" }} />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => (x ** 2) / 3} />

    <LaTeX tex={"a"} at={[3, -0.2]} />
    <LaTeX tex={"x"} at={[4, -0.2]} />

    <Polygon
        points={[
            [3, 0],
            [3, 3 ** 2 / 3],
            [4, 3 ** 2 / 3],
            [4, 0],
        ]}
        color={color("green")}
    />
    <Polygon
        points={[
            [3, 3 ** 2 / 3],
            [4, 3 ** 2 / 3],
            [4, 4 ** 2 / 3],
        ]}
        color={color("red")}
    />
</Mafs>

The total area can be approximated by the blue, green, and red areas.

- The blue area is the current area under the curve, $A(a)$.
- The green area is a rectangle;
    - The width is the change in $x$, $x - a$.
    - The height is the value of the function at $a$, $f(a)$, which is the slope of the area $A(a)$.
    - Hence the area of the green rectangle is $\dv{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a)$.
- The red area is a small triangle;
    - The base is the change in $x$, $x - a$.
    - The height is the slope of the function at $a$, $\dv{f}{x}(a)$. Since $f$ is the derivative of $A$, this is the second derivative of $A$.
    - Hence the area of the red triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \dv[2]{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a)^2$.

The total area is then:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A(x) &= \class{blue}{\text{blue area}} + \class{green}{\text{green area}} + \class{red}{\text{red area}} \\
&= \class{blue}{A(a)} + \class{green}{\dv{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a)} + \class{red}{\frac{1}{2} \dv[2]{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a)^2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

This is equivalent to the Taylor series expansion of $A(x)$ centered at $a$:

$$
\begin{equation}
A(x) = A(a) + \dv{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a) + \frac{1}{2} \dv[2]{A}{x}(a) \cdot (x - a)^2 + \ldots
\end{equation}
$$

This shows how interconnected the various concepts in calculus are.

Recall from Equation $\eqref{eq:taylor_and_maclaurin_series-sigma}$ that the Maclaurin series of a function $f(x)$ centered at $a = 0$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \dv[n]{f}{x}(0) x^n
\end{equation}
$$

We only need to find the second degree Maclaurin polynomial, so we only need to find the first three terms of the series:

$$
\begin{equation}
p(x) = f(0) + \dv{f}{x}(0) x + \frac{1}{2!} \dv[2]{f}{x}(0) x^2
\end{equation}
$$

The derivatives of $f(x)$ are:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= (x + 1)^{-1/2} \\
\dv{f}{x} &= -\frac{1}{2} (x + 1)^{-3/2} \\
\dv[2]{f}{x} &= \frac{3}{4} (x + 1)^{-5/2}
\end{align}
$$

Evaluating these derivatives at $x = 0$:

$$
\begin{align}
f(0) &= 1 \\
\dv{f}{x}(0) &= -\frac{1}{2} \\
\dv[2]{f}{x}(0) &= \frac{3}{4}
\end{align}
$$

Substitute these values into the polynomial:

$$
\begin{equation}
p(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} x + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} x^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2} x + \frac{3}{8} x^2
\end{equation}
$$
