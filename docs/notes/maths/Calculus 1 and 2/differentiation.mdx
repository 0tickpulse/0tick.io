# Differentiation

Differentiation is the process of finding the _derivative_ of a function.

Imagine a car moving along a road. The car's position at time $t$ is given by a function $s(t)$.
Let's say we graph the car's position as a function of time:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [0, 10],
        y: [0, 10],
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => (1 / 2) * x} />
</Mafs>

To find the car's velocity, $v$, at time $t$, we can find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of $s(t)$ at $t$.
In this case, since it is a straight line, we can simply take two points and find $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$:

export function SimpleSlope() {
    const x1 = useMovablePoint([4, 2], {
        constrain: ([x, y]) => [x, (1 / 2) * x],
    });
    const x2 = useMovablePoint([10, 5], {
        constrain: ([x, y]) => [x, (1 / 2) * x],
    });

    return (
        <>
            <Mafs
                viewBox={{
                        x: [0, 10],
                        y: [0, 10],
                    }}>

                {x2.element}

            <MathEquation displayMode={true}>{String.raw`
                \begin{align*}
                    \text{Slope} &= \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\

                    &= \frac{1}{2}
                \end{align*}
            `}</MathEquation>
        </>
    );

}

<SimpleSlope />

The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{2}$, so the car's velocity at any given time $t$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

However, in most cases the function will not be a straight line, so we need a more general way to find the slope, which is where the derivative comes in.

## Derivative from Limits

Instead of thinking about the slope of a function as a whole, a derivative deals with the slope at a singular point.
Let's say we have a function $f(x)$:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [0, 8],
        y: [0, 6],
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => (1 / 5) * Math.pow(x, 2)} />
</Mafs>

Suppose we want to find the slope of the function at $x = 3$.
What this means is that if we construct line that's tangent to the graph of $f(x)$ at $x = 3$, what is the slope of that line?

To find the slope of the tangent line at $x = 3$, we can take two points on the graph of $f(x)$ that are very close to $x = 3$.
Let's say we take $x = 3$ and $x = 3 + \Delta x$:

<DerivativeFromLimits />

From the above, we can see that the slope of the tangent line at $x = 3$ can be expressed as follows:

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(3 + \Delta x) - f(3)}{\Delta x}
$$

As $\Delta x$ approaches $0$, the slope of the tangent line approaches a certain value.
**This value is the _derivative_ of the function $f(x)$ at $x = 3$.**

As such, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

:::info Symbols

-   Some textbooks use $h$ instead of $\Delta x$ for some reason.
-   The derivative of a function $f(x)$ is often denoted as $f'(x)$, pronounced "f prime of x".
-   $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is known as _Leibniz notation_, while $f'(x)$ is known as _Lagrange notation_.

:::

### Delta and d

In the above, we used $\Delta x$ to represent a small change in $x$, and likewise for $\Delta y$.
As the change approaches $0$, another symbol is used to represent this infinitesimally small change: $dx$ and $dy$.

When using $d$, the concept of it approaching $0$ is "built-in" to the symbol, so we can write the derivative as:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx}
$$

If we want to differentiate, let's say, $x^2$, we can write it as:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^2 \text{ or } \frac{d(x^2)}{dx}
$$

The fraction on the left is the _differential operator_.

While some textbooks suggest that $\frac{dy}{dx}$ shouldn't be thought of as a fraction, it's often much more intuitive to think of it as one.
Even though it's not a fraction in the strictest sense, it behaves like one in many ways, and it is indeed a slope after all.
Furthermore, when $dy$ and $dx$ are seen by themselves, they are much easier to understand. This is important especially in implicit differentiation.

## Differentiation of Sums of Functions

The derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of the derivatives of the functions. To demonstrate this, let's find the derivative of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{5} x^2 + \frac{1}{3} x$.

Once again, let's find the derivative at $x = 3$. Look at the figure below:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [-2, 2],
        y: [-2, 6],
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => 1 / 5 * Math.pow(x, 2) + 1 / 3 * x} />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => 1 / 3 * x} />

    <Vector
        tail={[3, 0]}
        tip={[3, 1 / 3 * 3]}
    />
    <LaTeX
        tex={String.raw`\frac{1}{3}x`}
        at={[3 + 0.5, (1 / 3 * 3) * 0.5]}
    />
    <Vector
        tail={[3, 1 / 3 * 3]}
        tip={[3, 1 / 5 * 3 * 3 + 1 / 3 * 3]}
    />
    <LaTeX
        tex={String.raw`\frac{1}{5}x^2`}
        at={[3 + 0.5, (1 / 5 * 3 * 3) * 0.5 + 1 / 3 * 3]}
    />

</Mafs>

The straight line is the $\frac{1}{3} x$ part, and the curve is the whole function.
The two arrows represent that at that point, the total value of the function is the sum of the two terms, with each arrow representing one term.

Recall that to take the slope, you imagine another point some distance $dx$ away and measure how much $y$ changes:

export function DifferentiationSum({ split = false }) {
    const f = (x) => 1 / 5 * Math.pow(x, 2) + 1 / 3 * x;
    const f1 = (x) => 1 / 3 * x;
    const f2 = (x) => 1 / 5 * Math.pow(x, 2);
    return (
        <Mafs
            viewBox={{
                x: [-2, 2],
                y: [-2, 6],
            }}

                    <LaTeX
                        tex={String.raw`d(\frac{1}{5} x^2 + \frac{1}{3} x)`}
                        at={[4 + 1.5, (f(3) + f(4)) / 2]}
                    />
                </>)}
        </Mafs>
    );

}

<DifferentiationSum />

The key idea is that this green $dy$ can be "split" into two parts: one from the $\frac{1}{5} x^2$ term and one from the $\frac{1}{3} x$ term.

<DifferentiationSum split={true} />

Therefore:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{5} x^2 + \frac{1}{3} x \right) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{5} x^2 \right) + \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{3} x \right)
$$

Or more generally,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) + g(x) \right) = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + \frac{d}{dx} g(x)
\end{equation}
$$

## Differentiation of Products of Functions

The derivative of a product of functions is a bit more complicated.

However there's still a neat visual way to understand it. Let's say we have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{5} x^2 \quad \text{and} \quad g(x) = \ln{x}
$$

Generally, to visualize products, we can think of the area of a rectangle.

export function SimpleProducts() {
    const f = (x) => 1 / 5 * Math.pow(x, 2);
    const g = (x) => Math.log(x);

    const [x, setX] = useState(3);

    const area = f(x) * g(x);

    return (<>
        <Mafs
            viewBox={{
                x: [0, 7],
                y: [-3, 3],
            }}
        >
            {/* x-axis is f(x), y-axis is g(x) */}
            <Polygon
                points={[
                    [0, 0],
                    [0, g(x)],
                    [f(x), g(x)],
                    [f(x), 0],
                ]}
                color={area > 0 ? Theme.green : Theme.red}
            />
            <LaTeX
                tex={String.raw`f(x)`}
                at={[f(x) / 2, Math.min(g(x), 0) - 0.5]}
            />
            <LaTeX
                tex={String.raw`g(x)`}
                at={[-0.5, g(x) / 2]}
            />
        </Mafs>
        <div>
            <input
                type="range"
                min={-10}
                max={10}
                step={0.1}
                value={x}
                onChange={(e) => setX(parseFloat(e.target.value))}
            />
            <span>{x}</span>
        </div>
    </>)

}

<SimpleProducts />

Now imagine that $x$ increases by a small amount $dx$. The change in the product, $dy$, can be thought of as the change in the area of the rectangle.

export function DifferenceInArea({ split = false }) {
    const f = (x) => 1 / 5 * Math.pow(x, 2);
    const g = (x) => Math.log(x);

    const originalX = 3;
    const [x, setX] = useState(4);

    const area = f(originalX) * g(originalX);

    return (<>

<DifferenceInArea />

We can split the change in area into three parts:

<DifferenceInArea split={true} />

Therefore, the change in the product can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align*}
d(f(x) \cdot g(x)) &= \textcolor{red}{(f(x) \cdot d(g(x)))} \\
&+ \textcolor{yellow}{(g(x) \cdot d(f(x)))} \\
&+ \textcolor{blue}{(d(f(x)) \cdot d(g(x)))} \\
\end{align*}
$$

The last term, $d(f(x)) \cdot d(g(x))$, will approach $0$ because it is the product of two infinitesimally small changes.
Therefore, the derivative of the product of two functions is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) \cdot g(x) \right) = f(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)
$$

Another way to write this is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(x) \cdot g(x) \right) = f(x) \cdot g'(x) + g(x) \cdot f'(x)
$$

## Chain Rule

The chain rule is a way to differentiate composite functions.

Let's say we have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, and we want to find the derivative of $f(g(x))$.

To do this, we can think of $f(g(x))$ as a function of $g(x)$, and then differentiate that function with respect to $x$.

Conceptually, the chain rule can be thought of as a way to "break down" the function into smaller parts.

Imagine a knob that you can turn to change $x$, and that turns another knob that changes $g(x)$, which in turn changes $f(g(x))$.

To measure how much $f(g(x))$ changes when you turn the first knob, you can measure how much $g(x)$ changes, and then how much $f(g(x))$ changes when you change $g(x)$.

Another way to think of it is through algebraic manipulation, assuming $y = f(g(x))$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx}
$$

### Proof

To prove the chain rule, let's say we have a function $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$,
assuming that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at some point $x$.

The derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(g(x + \Delta x)) - f(g(x))}{\Delta x}
$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta u} \cdot \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta u} \cdot \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $f$ is differentiable at $u$, as $\Delta x \to 0$, $\Delta u \to 0$. Thus:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \lim_{{\color{red} \cancel{\Delta x \to 0}} \Delta u \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta u} \cdot \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta x} \\
&= \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \\
&= f'(u) \cdot g'(x) \\
&= f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
\end{align*}
$$

## Powers

The derivative of a power function is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n \cdot x^{n - 1}
$$

To show this, let's make a general power function $f(x) = x^n$ and apply the limit to it:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{(x + \Delta x)^n - x^n}{\Delta x}
$$

The $(x + \Delta x)^n$ term is a binomial. In an expanded binomial, you're essentially choosing every possible combination of terms from the two binomials.
For example, $(x + a)^3$ expands to $x^3 + 3x^2a + 3xa^2 + a^3$ because:

-   There's one way to choose $x^3a^0$ from $x$ and $a$: $x \cdot x \cdot x$
-   There are three ways to choose $x^2a^1$ from $x$ and $a$: $x \cdot x \cdot a$, $x \cdot a \cdot x$, and $a \cdot x \cdot x$
-   There are three ways to choose $x^1a^2$ from $x$ and $a$: $x \cdot a \cdot a$, $a \cdot x \cdot a$, and $a \cdot a \cdot x$
-   There's one way to choose $a^3x^0$ from $x$ and $a$: $a \cdot a \cdot a$

The formalization of this is the _binomial theorem_:

$$
(x + a)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} a^k
$$

Where $\binom{n}{k}$ is the _binomial coefficient_, which is what you get when you choose $k$ items from $n$ items.

Applying this to the limit:

$$
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{(x + \Delta x)^n - x^n}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} (\Delta x)^k - x^n}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{1}{\Delta x} \left( \cancel{x^n} + \binom{n}{1} x^{n - 1} (\Delta x)^1 + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} x^0 (\Delta x)^n - \cancel{x^n} \right) \\
\end{align*}
$$

The key part is that after canceling out the $x^n$ terms, the only term that remains is the one where $k = 1$.
This is because the other terms have a $\Delta x$ in them, which will go to $0$ as $\Delta x$ approaches $0$.

Therefore, the derivative of $x^n$ is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n \cdot x^{n - 1}
$$

:::info What about non-integers?

The above formula works for all real powers, not just integers. Here's a proof.

Let's say we have a power function:

$$
f(x) = x^r = \exp(r \ln{x}) \quad \text{where } r \in \mathbb{R}
$$

To find the derivative, we can use the chain rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx} \exp(r \ln{x}) \\
&= \exp(r \ln{x}) \cdot \frac{d}{dx} (r \ln{x}) \\
&= x^r \cdot \frac{d}{dx} (r \ln{x}) \\
&= x^r \cdot r \cdot \frac{1}{x} \\
&= r \cdot x^{r - 1}
\end{align*}
$$

A few things to note:

-   This relies on the fact that the derivative of $\ln{x}$ is $\frac{1}{x}$.
-   This also relies on the fact that the derivative of $\exp{x}$ is itself $\exp{x}$.

## Derivative of Trigonometric Functions

The derivatives of the trigonometric functions are as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \sin{x} &= \cos{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \cos{x} &= -\sin{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \tan{x} &= \sec^2{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \cot{x} &= -\csc^2{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \sec{x} &= \sec{x} \tan{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \csc{x} &= -\csc{x} \cot{x}
\end{align*}
$$

We'll just look at the first one, $\frac{d}{dx} \sin{x} = \cos{x}$, to show how it's derived.

(TODO)

The derivative of $\cos{x}$ can be derived in a similar way.

The derivatives of $\tan{x}$, $\cot{x}$, $\sec{x}$, and $\csc{x}$ can be derived using the quotient rule.

## Differentiability and Continuity

The differentiability of a function at a point refers to whether the function has a derivative at that point.

The important thing to note is this: if a function $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$, then it is continuous at $x = a$.

However, the converse is not necessarily true: a function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable at that point.

As previously mentioned, a function is continuous at a point if:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)
$$

A function is differentiable at a point if:

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(a + \Delta x) - f(a)}{\Delta x}
$$

To prove that differentiability implies continuity, we'll use a slightly different form of the limit definition of the derivative:

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
$$

Let's suppose we want to find this limit below, assuming $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) - f(a) &= \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \cdot (x - a) \\
&= \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \cdot \lim_{x \to a} (x - a) \\
&= f'(a) \cdot 0 \\
&= 0 \\
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) - f(a) &= 0 \\
\therefore \lim_{x \to a} f(x) &= f(a)
\end{align*}
$$

Hence, if $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$, then it is continuous at $x = a$.

## Higher Order Derivatives

The derivative of a function is itself a function, so it can be differentiated again.

The second derivative of a function $f(x)$ is denoted as $f''(x)$ or $\frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x)$, the latter being sort of a notation hack.

The second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative, and the third derivative is the derivative of the second derivative, and so on.

Higher order derivatives can be denoted as $f^{(n)}(x)$, where $n$ is the order of the derivative.

## Implicit Differentiation and the Natural Log

Implicit differentiation is a way to differentiate functions that are not explicitly defined.

For example, consider the equation of a circle:

$$
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
$$

To differentiate this, we can treat $r$ as some constant and $x^2 + y^2$ as some function $P(x, y)$.
Just like how we took small changes in $x$ to find the derivative of $x^2$, we can take small changes in $x$ and $y$ to find the derivative of $P(x, y)$.

$$
dP = 2x \cdot dx + 2y \cdot dy
$$

Remember that $P$ should be constant, so $dP = 0$.

$$
\begin{align*}
2x \cdot dx + 2y \cdot dy &= 0 \\
2x \cdot dx &= -2y \cdot dy \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{x}{y}
\end{align*}
$$

We can also use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of the natural logarithm.

Given $y = \ln{x}$, we can rewrite this as $e^y = x$. Then, we can once again think of moving along both the $x$ and $y$ axes and find the derivative of $e^y$ with respect to $x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
e^y &= x \\
e^y dy &= dx \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{1}{e^y} = \frac{1}{x}
\end{align*}
$$

## Quotient Rule

The quotient rule is a way to differentiate functions that are the ratio of two functions.
It can be derived using information from the above sections.

Given $f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, the derivative of $f(x)$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \right) &= \frac{d}{dx} \left( g(x) \frac{1}{h(x)} \right) \\
&= g'(x) \frac{1}{h(x)} + g(x) \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{h(x)} \right) \tag{product rule} \\
&= g'(x) \frac{1}{h(x)} - g(x) \frac{1}{h(x)^2} h'(x) \tag{chain rule} \\
&= \frac{g'(x) h(x) - g(x) h'(x)}{h(x)^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the derivative of $\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$ is:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \right) = \frac{g'(x) h(x) - g(x) h'(x)}{h(x)^2}
$$

## Derivatives of Exponential Functions

$e^x$ is a special function because its derivative is itself.

This can be shown via implicit differentiation:

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= e^x \\
\ln{y} &= x \\
\frac{d}{dx} \ln{y} &= \frac{d}{dx} x \\
\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} &= 1 \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= y = e^x
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, you can use the limit definition of the derivative:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} e^x &= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{e^{x + \Delta x} - e^x}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{e^x e^{\Delta x} - e^x}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{e^x (e^{\Delta x} - 1)}{\Delta x} \\
&= e^x \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{e^{\Delta x} - 1}{\Delta x} \\
&= e^x 1 \\
&= e^x
\end{align*}
$$

To find the derivative of $a^x$, where $a$ is some constant, you can use the chain rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} a^x &= \frac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln{a}} \\
&= e^{x \ln{a}} \ln{a} \\
&= a^x \ln{a}
\end{align*}
$$

### Example: Derivative of $x^x$

To find the derivative of $x^x$, you can rewrite it as $e^{x \ln{x}}$ and then differentiate it:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} x^x &= \frac{d}{dx} e^{x \ln{x}} \\
&= e^{x \ln{x}} \ln{x} + e^{x \ln{x}} \frac{1}{x} \\
&= x^x \ln{x} + \frac{x^x}{x} \\
&= x^x (\ln{x} + 1)
\end{align*}
$$

## Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions

The derivative of $\ln{x}$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, as shown previously.

To find the derivative of $\log_a{x}$, you can use the change of base formula.

Start with $\log_a{x} = y$, then rewrite it as $a^y = x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\log_a{x} &= y \\
a^y &= x \\
\ln{a^y} &= \ln{x} \\
y \ln{a} &= \ln{x} \\
y &= \frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{a}} \\
\log_a{x} &= \frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{a}}
\end{align*}
$$

Crucially, $\ln$ can be of any base.

Using this, you can find the derivative of $\log_a{x}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \log_a{x} &= \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\ln{x}}{\ln{a}} \\
&= \frac{1}{x \ln{a}}
\end{align*}
$$

## Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions

The derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions are as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \arcsin{x} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccos{x} &= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \arctan{x} &= \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccot{x} &= -\frac{1}{1 + x^2} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \arcsec{x} &= \frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccsc{x} &= -\frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}
\end{align*}
$$

To find the derivative of $\arcsin{x}$, you can use implicit differentiation.

Start with $y = \arcsin{x}$, then rewrite it as $\sin{y} = x$.

$$
\begin{align*}
y &= \arcsin{x} \\
\sin{y} &= x \\
\frac{d}{dx} \sin{y} &= \frac{d}{dx} x \\
\cos{y} \frac{dy}{dx} &= 1 \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{1}{\cos{y}} \\
\end{align*}
$$

To find $\cos{y}$, you can use the Pythagorean identity $\sin^2{y} + \cos^2{y} = 1$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin^2{y} + \cos^2{y} &= 1 \\
\cos^2{y} &= 1 - \sin^2{y} \\
\cos{y} &= \sqrt{1 - \sin^2{y}} \\
\cos{y} &= \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
$$

The derivative of $\arcsec{x}$ can be found similarly.

The derivatives of the other inverse trigonometric functions can be found similarly.

## Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions

Hyperbolic functions are analogs of the trigonometric functions, defined in terms of exponentials.

For example, $\sinh{x} = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$ and $\cosh{x} = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$.

Instead of tracing a unit circle, hyperbolic functions trace a unit hyperbola, which is why they're called "hyperbolic".

A circle is defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, while a hyperbola is defined by $x^2 - y^2 = 1$.

Both the hyperbolic and trigonometric functions have similar properties, including derivatives.

The unit hyperbola and unit circle are shown below:

<Mafs
    scale={1.5}
    height={200}
    origin={[0, 0]}
    viewBox={{
        x: [-2, 2],
        y: [-2, 2],
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.Parametric
        xy={(t) => [Math.cosh(t), Math.sinh(t)]}
        t={[0, 15]}

    <Plot.Parametric
        xy={(t) => [Math.cos(t), Math.sin(t)]}
        t={[0, 2 * Math.PI]}
    />
</Mafs>

The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions are as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \sinh{x} &= \cosh{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \cosh{x} &= \sinh{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \tanh{x} &= \text{sech}^2{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \coth{x} &= -\text{csch}^2{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \text{sech}{x} &= -\text{sech}{x} \tanh{x} \\
\frac{d}{dx} \text{csch}{x} &= -\text{csch}{x} \coth{x}
\end{align*}
$$
