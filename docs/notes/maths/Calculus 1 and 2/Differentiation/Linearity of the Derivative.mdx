# Linearity of the Derivative

In the previous sections, we discussed the concept of the derivative of a function and how it can be used to describe the rate of change of the function at a specific point.
In this section, we will explore some properties of the derivative that are crucial in calculus.
Specifically, we will discuss the **linearity of the derivative**.

## Adding Functions

Suppose we have two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, and we want to find the derivative of their sum, $f(x) + g(x)$.

Recall that the derivative is essentially a limit of an average rate of change, which is a ratio of the change of the function to the change in the input.
Therefore, we can write the derivative of $f(x) + g(x)$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{x} (f(x) + g(x)) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{\Delta (f(x) + g(x))}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

So, the question is, what is $\Delta (f(x) + g(x))$?
Well, it is simply the sum of the changes in $f(x)$ and $g(x)$: $\Delta f(x) + \Delta g(x)$.

One can easily show this by expanding the expression:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta (f(x) + g(x)) &= f(x + h) + g(x + h) - f(x) - g(x) \\
&= f(x + h) - f(x) + g(x + h) - g(x) \\
&= \Delta f(x) + \Delta g(x)
\end{equation}
$$

However, we can also see this on a graph. Let's consider the graph of $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^2$ and $g(x) = \frac{1}{2} x$, as well as their sum:
