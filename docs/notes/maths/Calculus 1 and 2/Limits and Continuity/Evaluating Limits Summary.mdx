# Evaluating Limits: Summary

In the previous sections, we discussed how to evaluate limits using different algebraic methods.
Of course, there are many more methods to evaluate limits, but the ones we discussed are the most common and useful.
Here is a summary of the methods we discussed:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Limit["Limit of f(x) as x approaches a"] --> DS["Direct Substitution: f(a)"]
    DS --> DSYes["f(a) is defined"] --> DSYesContinuous["f is continuous at a"] --> DSYesContinuousYes["Limit = f(a)"]
           DSYes --> DSYesDiscontinuous["f is discontinuous at a"]
    DS --> DSAsymptote["f(a) = something/0 (Probably an asymptote)"] --> DSAsymptoteYes["Limit = ∞ or -∞"]
    DS --> DSIndeterminate["Indeterminate Form: 0/0 or ∞/∞"]
    DSIndeterminate ---> Algebra["Algebraic Manipulation"] --> Factoring["Factor and simplify"]
    Algebra --> Rationalize["Rationalize the expression"]
    Algebra --> Trig["Use trigonometric identities"]
    Algebra ---> Fails["When everything fails"] --> Advanced["More advanced methods"]
    Fails --> Approximation["Approximation"]
```

In the next sections, we will explore the "more advanced methods" to evaluate limits, such as the Squeeze Theorem.
