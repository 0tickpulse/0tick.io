# Algebraic Properties of Limits

In this section, we will discuss some algebraic properties of limits that can help us evaluate limits of more complex functions.

:::warning No Proofs

Note that we will not be providing formal proofs for these properties.
The proofs are typically more involved and require a deeper understanding of the concepts involved.

Generally, these properties can be proven using the formal definition of limits, which falls into the realm of real analysis.

## Limit of a Sum

The limit of a sum of two functions is the sum of their limits;

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \to a} [f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x)
\end{equation}
$$

This property can be extended to the sum of multiple functions:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \to a} [f_1(x) + f_2(x) + \ldots + f_n(x)] = \lim_{x \to a} f_1(x) + \lim_{x \to a} f_2(x) + \ldots + \lim_{x \to a} f_n(x)
\end{equation}
$$
