# Informal Definition and Notation

The limit can be informally defined as the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value.
In other words, it is the value that the function gets closer and closer to as the input gets closer and closer to a certain value.

Consider the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.
This is a reciprocal function, and as you increase the value of $x$, the value of $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to $0$:

$$
\begin{align}
    f(1) &= 1 \\
    f(10) &= 0.1 \\
    f(100) &= 0.01 \\
    f(1000) &= 0.001 \\
    f(10000) &= 0.0001 \\
    f(100000) &= 0.00001 \\
    \vdots
\end{align}
$$

This can also be seen graphically by plotting the function. Let's plot $f(x) = \abs{\frac{1}{x}}$:

<Mafs>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => Math.abs(1 / x)} />
</Mafs>

When we use the graph to visualize the function, we can make an estimate for the limit.
This is a good way to get an intuition for what the limit is.

As you can see, as $x$ gets larger and larger, $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to $0$.
While $f(x)$ never actually reaches $0$, it gets arbitrarily close to it. This is what we call a limit.

In terms of words, we can say:

> The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches infinity is $0$.

This is written with notation as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0
\end{equation}
$$

Here, the $\lim$ symbol represents the limit, $x \to \infty$ means that $x$ is approaching infinity, and $f(x)$ is the function we are taking the limit of:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathclap{\overset{\class{blue}{\text{Limit of}}}{\overset{\class{blue}{\downarrow}}{\underset{\class{yellow}{\text{as} \ x \text{ approaches } \infty}}{\underset{\class{yellow}{\uparrow}}{\lim_{x \to \infty}}}}}} \phantom{\lim_{x \to \infty}} f(x) = 0
\end{equation}
$$

Next, consider the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$.
This time, the value of $f(x)$ gets larger and larger as $x$ gets closer and closer to $0$.
As such, we can say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $0$ is **unbounded**.

This is written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \infty
\end{equation}
$$

## Summary and Next Steps

We have introduced the concept of limits and how they can be informally defined.
Here are the key points to remember:

1. The limit of a function is the value that the function approaches as the input approaches a certain value.
2. The limit of a function as the input approaches some value $a$ is written as $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$.
3. If a limit is unbounded, it means that the function grows without bound as the input approaches the value.
4. A limit can be estimated by looking at the graph of the function.

Next, we will look at the concept of One-Sided Limits.
