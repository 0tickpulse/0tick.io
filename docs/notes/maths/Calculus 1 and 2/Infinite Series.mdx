# Infinite Series

Infinite series are essentially sums of an infinite number of terms.
There's a lot of interesting properties and theorems that come out of them.

Although some courses cover infinite series before calculus, analysis of infinite series heavily involves calculus.
Therefore, trying to understand infinite series without a solid understanding of calculus makes it difficult to grasp the full picture.

## Philosophy of Infinite Series

There's actually a lot of philosophy behind infinite series.

Firstly, most philosophers agree that an actual infinite cannot exist in the physical world.
This is because it leads to paradoxes, such as Hilbert's Hotel.

Therefore, we treat them instead as _potential_ infinites.
This means that we can keep adding terms to the series, but we never actually "reach" the infinite.

Hold your hands out in front of you.

Now, move them halfway together.
Then, move them halfway again.

You can keep doing this forever, but you'll never actually touch your hands together.
There i0't an infinite number of points between your hands, but you can keep dividing the distance in half.

This also means that when we say "the sum of the series **equals** $1$", we're not saying that the sum _is_ $1$, but that it _approaches_ $1$ as the number of terms approaches infinity.
Perhaps this is a bit pedantic, but it's an important distinction.
It is also probably one of the main reasons for the debate of whether or not $0.999\dots = 1$.

## Convergence and Divergence

The most important concept in infinite series is that of convergence and divergence.

A series is said to converge if the sequence of partial sums converges to a finite limit.
In other words, if the sum of the series approaches a finite number as the number of terms approaches infinity, then the series converges.

A series is said to diverge if the sequence of partial sums does not converge to a finite limit.

### Example Problem: Convergence of a Set

> Consider the set of numbers:
>
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> \qty{1, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, -\frac{1}{6}, \dots}
> \end{equation}
> $$
>
> What does this set converge to?

Let's first visualize this by plotting the terms of the series:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [1, 10],
        y: [-1, 1]
    }}
>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    {range(1, 20).map((n) => (
        <Point x={n} y={n % 2 === 0 ? -1 / n : 1 / n} key={n} />
    ))}
</Mafs>

Just visually, it seems like the series is converging to $0$.

We can also show this through algebra.
When considering series, we often use the concept of the limit of a sequence towards infinity.

So first, we need to decide on an expression for the $n$-th term.
We have the fraction $1/n$ when $n$ is odd, and $-1/n$ when $n$ is even.
To add the sign, we can use $(-1)^n$.

Therefore, the $n$-th term is:

$$
\begin{equation}
a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}
\end{equation}
$$

Meaning, the set can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\qty{a_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \quad a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}
\end{equation}
$$

Now, we can find the limit of the sequence as $n$ approaches infinity:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 0
\end{equation}
$$

### Example Problem: Convergence of Different Sequences (Informally)

> Evaluate the convergence of the following sequences:
>
> 1. $\displaystyle a_n = \frac{(n + 8)(n + 1)}{n(n - 10)}$
> 2. $\displaystyle b_n = \frac{e^n + 1}{e \cdot n + 1}$
> 3. $\displaystyle c_n = \frac{n^2 + 1}{n + 1000}$
> 4. $\displaystyle d_n = (-1)^n$
>
> [(Source)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-series-new/bc-10-1/v/identifying-sequence-convergence-divergence)

We can evaluate the convergence of these sequences by finding the limit of the sequence as $n$ approaches infinity.

1. $\displaystyle a_n = \frac{(n + 8)(n + 1)}{n(n - 10)}$

    We can find the limit of this sequence by considering the degree of the numerator and denominator:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(n + 8)(n + 1)}{n(n - 10)} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^2 + 9n + 8}{n^2 - 10n}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Since both the numerator and denominator have the same degree, then the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients, which is $1$.
    Therefore, the sequence convergences.

2. $\displaystyle b_n = \frac{e^n + 1}{e \cdot n + 1}$

    Notice that the numerator has a $e^n$ term, which grows much faster than the $e \cdot n$ term in the denominator.
    Therefore, the limit of the sequence is $\infty$, and the sequence diverges.

3. $\displaystyle c_n = \frac{n^2 + 1}{n + 1000}$

    Since the numerator has a higher degree ($n^2$) than the denominator ($n$), the limit of the sequence is $\infty$, and the sequence diverges.

4. $\displaystyle d_n = (-1)^n$

    This one is interesting.
    As $n$ increases, the sequence alternates between $1$ and $-1$.
    Although it's not unbounded, it doe0't converge to a single value.
    Therefore, the sequence diverges.

## Partial Sums

Recall that the $n$th partial sum of a series is the sum of the first $n$ terms of the series.

Let $S$ be an infinite series:

$$
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots
\end{equation}
$$

The $n$th partial sum of $S$ is denoted by $S_n$ and is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n
\end{equation}
$$

### Example Problem: Evaluating Partial Sums

> The series $S$ is given by:
>
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n + 1)}
> \end{equation}
> $$
>
> 1. Evaluate $S_{100}$.
> 2. Find a general formula for $S_n$.

The $n$th term of the series is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
a_n = \frac{1}{n(n + 1)}
\end{equation}
$$

1. Of course we won't manually sum the first $100$ terms, so we'll manipulate the series a bit to hopefully find a pattern.

    We can use partial fractions to split the series into two:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} &= \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n + 1} \\
    1 &= A(n + 1) + Bn
    \end{align}
    $$

    Let $n = 0$:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    1 &= A(1) + B(0) \\
    A &= 1
    \end{align}
    $$

    Let $n = -1$:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    1 &= A(0) + B(-1) \\
    B &= -1
    \end{align}
    $$

    Therefore, the series can be expressed as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{n(n + 1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Therefore, $S_{100}$ can be expressed as:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    S_{100} &= \sum_{n=1}^{100} \qty(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1}) \\
    &= \qty(\frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2}) + \qty(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}) + \dots + \qty(\frac{1}{100} - \frac{1}{101}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{1} - \cancel{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} - \cancel{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} - \dots - \cancel{\frac{1}{100}} - \frac{1}{101} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{1}{101} \\
    &= \frac{100}{101}
    \end{align}
    $$

2. We can generalize what we did above to find a general formula for $S_n$:

    Using the same cancellation method as above, we can find that:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    S_n &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \qty(\frac{1}{i} - \frac{1}{i + 1}) \\
    &= \qty(\frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2}) + \qty(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}) + \dots + \qty(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n + 1}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{1} - \cancel{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} - \cancel{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} - \dots - \cancel{\frac{1}{n}} - \frac{1}{n + 1} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{1}{n + 1} \\
    &= \frac{n}{n + 1}
    \end{align}
    $$

### Example Problem: Identifying nth Term From Partial Sums

> The $n$th partial sum of a series is given by:
>
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> S_n = \frac{n - 1}{n}
> \end{equation}
> $$
>
> Find the $n$th term of the series, $a_n$.

The trick to this problem is to notice the relationship between the partial sum and the $n$th term:

$$
\begin{align}
S_n &= a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 1} + a_n \\
- \quad S_{n - 1} &= a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_{n - 1} \\
\hline
S_n - S_{n - 1} &= a_n
\end{align}
$$

We can use this relationship to find the $n$th term of the series:

$$
\begin{align}
a_n &= S_{\class{blue}{n}} - S_{\class{yellow}{n - 1}} \\
&= \frac{\class{blue}{n} - 1}{\class{blue}{n}} - \frac{\class{yellow}{n - 1} - 1}{\class{yellow}{n - 1}} \\
&= \frac{(n - 1)^2 - n(n - 2)}{n(n - 1)} \\
&= \frac{\cancel{n^2 - 2n} + 1 - \cancel{n^2 + 2n}}{n(n - 1)} \\
&= \frac{1}{n(n - 1)}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, the sum of the series is:

$$
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n - 1)}
\end{equation}
$$

## To Infinity and Beyond

We've dealt with partial sums, that is, the sum of the first $n$ terms of a series.
But what happens when we sum an infinite number of terms?

Generally, we can say that the sum of an infinite series is the limit of $S_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity.
If this limit exists and is finite, then the series converges, and diverges otherwise.

### Example Problem: Sum of an Infinite Series

> Find the sum of the series:
>
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^3}{n^2 + 1}
> \end{equation}
> $$

We can find the sum of this series by finding the limit of the sequence as $n$ approaches infinity:

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^3}{n^2 + 1} &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^3}{n^2} \\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} n \\
&= \infty
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, the series diverges.

                })}
            </Transform>
        </Mafs>
    )
}

The geometric series is a special type of series where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term.
It's very intuitive to understand.

In fact, what's shown below is my own independent discovery of the geometric series.

Let's start with $1$. We can split this into $1/2 + 1/2$.

We can then split one of the $1/2$s into $1/4 + 1/4$, and so on:

$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \qty(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \qty(\frac{1}{4} + \qty(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8})) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \dots
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, we can write:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \qty(\frac{1}{2})^n = 1
\end{equation}
$$

<VisualGeometricSeries q={0.5} qrLabels={false} />

Let's see if we can think of another example.
Start with $1$ again, but this time split it into $9/10 + 1/10$, and then split the $1/10$ into $9/100 + 1/100$, and so on:

$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{1}{10} \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \qty(\frac{9}{100} + \frac{1}{100}) \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \qty(\frac{9}{100} + \qty(\frac{9}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000})) \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \frac{9}{10000} + \dots
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, we can write:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \qty(\frac{9}{10})^n = 1
\end{equation}
$$

And in other words,

$$
\begin{equation}
0.999\dots = 1
\end{equation}
$$

We can imagine generalizing this. Instead of exact quantities to split $1$ into, we can use variables.

Let $1 = q + r$, where both are less than 1. Then, we can generalize the geometric series from the previous example:

$$
\begin{align}
1 &= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{1}{10} &&= q + r \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{1}{100} &&= q + qr + r^2 \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \frac{1}{1000} &&= q + qr + qr^2 + r^3 \\
&= \frac{9}{10} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{9}{1000} + \frac{9}{10000} + \dots &&= q + qr + qr^2 + qr^3 + \dots
\end{align}
$$

<VisualGeometricSeries q={0.4} qrLabels={true} />

As such, we can write:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q \cdot r^n = 1
\end{equation}
$$

We can extract the $q$ from the series and rewrite it as $1 - r$:

$$
\begin{equation}
(1 - r) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n = 1
\end{equation}
$$

And after rearranging, we get:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n = \frac{1}{1 - r}
\end{equation}
$$

This is the general formula. Sometimes you also multiply everything by some $a$ to get:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\end{equation}
$$

One reason it's called a "geometric" series is that there's many clever geometric visualizations of different geometric series.

We need to keep in mind some of the conditions for this formula to hold.

Let's consider the geometric series when $r = 1$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 1^n = \frac{1}{1 - 1} = \frac{1}{0}
\end{equation}
$$

This is undefined, so the formula does not hold. Then, let's consider when $r = 1.1$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 1.1^n = \frac{1}{1 - 1.1} = \frac{1}{-0.1}
\end{equation}
$$

This does not make sense either, since according to the formula, the sum of the series is $-10$.

Therefore, the formula only holds when $-1 < r < 1$, or $|r| < 1$.
