# Introudction

Calculus 3 is the third course in the calculus series. It is also known as multivariable calculus. This course is an extension of the concepts learned in Calculus 1 and Calculus 2. In this course, we will learn about functions of several variables, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and vector calculus.

## Resources

- [Khan Academy: Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) - Taught by both Sal Khan and Grant Sanderson. Nice, but does not cover everything.
- [Advanced Calculus of Several Variables](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/docs/Advanced_Calculus.pdf) - A book by C.H. Edwards Jr. that covers the topics in this course.
