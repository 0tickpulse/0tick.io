## Introduction - Moving in a Force Field

Imagine a carboard box in someone's driveway. It's sitting still when, suddenly, the wind picks up - it's a hurricane!
The carboard box flies off the driveway and into the air, where gravity takes over and pulls it back down.
When it goes back down, it doesn't just fall straight down, the wind still pushes it left and right.

<Mafs viewBox={{ x: [0, 5], y: [0, 5] }}>
    <Circle center={[-2, 4]} radius={0.25} />
    <Circle center={[2, 1]} radius={0.25} />
    <Plot.Parametric t={[-2, 2]} xy={(t) => [t + -(t ** 2 - 4) * Math.cos(t / 5), (t ** 2) + (t + 2) * (-3 / 4) + (t ** 2 - 4) * (Math.sin(2 * t) - 2.5) / 2]} />
</Mafs>

    <summary>The curve in the visual</summary>

    I used quite a complex curve in the visual above:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \va{r}(t) = \mqty[ t - (t^2 - 4)\cos\qty(\frac{t}{5}) \\ t^2 + (t + 2)\qty(-\frac{3}{4}) + \frac{t^2 - 4}{2}\qty(\sin(2t) - 2.5) ]
    \end{equation}
    $$

    It's actually quite difficult to create a curve like this, because it needs to satisfy a few conditions:

    - It must start at a given point and end at a given point.
    - It must look chaotic, but not too chaotic.
    - It must not go off the screen.

    The initial point is $(-2, 4)$ and the final point is $(2, 1)$.
    I made $t$ range from $-2$ to $2$ to automatically satisfy the first condition in the $x$-direction.
    I added $(t + 2)\qty(-\frac{3}{4})$ to make the final point correct.

    Then, I just kept adding and subtracting terms until I got something that looked good.
    Each term gets $(t^2 - 4)$ to make sure that at the boundaries they are $0$, hence the curve still starts and ends at the correct points.

The force we are considering is gravity (ignore forces from the wind, just note that it affects the box's motion).
Recall that the work done due to a force is the dot product of the force and the distance moved:

$$
\begin{equation}
W = \va{F} \cdot \va{s}
\end{equation}
$$

(For a quick refresher on forces and work, see the appendix at the end of this page.)

However, we aren't just moving in a straight line - we are moving along a curve, due to the wind pushing the box around.
Instead, we can break the curve into small segments and sum the work done along each segment.

## Appendix: Forces and Work

When we talk about forces, we often talk about the work done by a force.
Imagine a force $\va{F}$ pushing on a ball, and the ball moves a distance $\va{s}$.

Let's say the force is gravity - $F = mg$, and it is pushing on a ball of mass $0.3 \, \text{kg}$.
The work done is defined by the product of the force and the distance moved:

$$
\begin{equation}
W = Fs = mgs
\end{equation}
$$

**However!** This is not the complete picture.
Gravity acts in the downward direction, but the ball is moving in a different direction:

<Mafs viewBox={{ x: [0, 5], y: [0, 5] }}>
    <Vector tail={[-2, 4]} tip={[2, 1]} />
    <Polyline points={[[-2, 4], [-2, 1], [2, 1]]} strokeStyle="dashed" />
    <LaTeX at={[-1.8, 2.5]} tex="3" />
    <LaTeX at={[0, 1.2]} tex="4" />
    <LaTeX at={[0, 3.5]} tex="4\hat{\mathbf{i}} - 3\hat{\mathbf{j}}" />
    <Circle center={[-2, 4]} radius={0.25} />
    <Circle center={[2, 1]} radius={0.25} />
</Mafs>

In that case, the work done considers only the distance moved in the **direction of the force**, in this case, $3$ units:

$$
\begin{equation}
W = \class{red}{m}\class{green}{g}\class{yellow}{s_y} = \class{red}{0.3\, \text{kg}} \times \class{green}{9.8\, \text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-2}} \times \class{yellow}{3\, \text{m}} = 8.82 \, \text{J}
\end{equation}
$$

This is otherwise known as the **dot product** of the force and the distance moved.
The complete formula for the work done in a straight line for a constant force is then:

$$
\begin{equation}
W = \va{F} \cdot \va{s}
\end{equation}
$$
