  Extending the integral to functions of multiple variables.

  Previously, we have seen how to integrate functions of one variable, as the accumulation of infinitesimal changes in the function.
  In this section, we will extend the concept of the integral to functions of multiple variables.
  This includes functions with single or multiple inputs and single or multiple outputs.
