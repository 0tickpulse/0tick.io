# Gradient Theorem

:::warning Todo

- Add some examples to demonstrate its usefulness.

:::

Previously, we introduced the concept of line integrals, which are integrals of functions along curves.
This is the first integral we have seen outside of single-variable calculus, so one natural question to ask is: how do we evaluate these integrals?

In single-variable calculus, we primarily rely on the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate integrals:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f'(x) \dd{x} = f(b) - f(a)
\end{equation}
$$

We will extend this theorem to line integrals in this section, a concept known as the fundamental theorem of line integrals, or the gradient theorem.
Additionally, we will explore some implications of this theorem, especially as a building block to understand the concept of conservative vector fields.

This section combines a lot of concepts like the fundamental theorem, line integrals, the gradient, the directional derivative, the multivariable chain rule, parametric curves, and more.
It's a lot to take in, but it's a crucial step in understanding the broader context of calculus in higher dimensions.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Review

To get an intuition behind the gradient theorem, we need to get a better understanding of the fundamental theorem of calculus in single-variable calculus.

Consider a function $f(x)$, which can represent anything.
Let's think about moving along the $x$-axis from $a$ to $b$, and consider how much $f$ changes as we move from $a$ to $b$.

1. Firstly, the change can simply be represented as $f(b) - f(a)$.

2. Second, let's try to add up incremental changes as we move along the curve.
    Each time we move a small distance $\dd{x}$, we can think of the change in $f$ as $f'(x) \dd{x}$.
    If we add up all these changes from $a$ to $b$, we get the integral:

    $$
    \int_a^b f'(x) \dd{x}
    $$

    <Mafs viewBox={{ x: [0, 8], y: [0, 5] }}>
        <Coordinates.Cartesian
            xAxis={{
                lines: false,
                labels: () => ""
            }}
            yAxis={{
                lines: false,
                labels: () => ""
            }}
        />
        <Plot.OfX y={(x) => Math.sin(x) + x} />

        <Line.Segment point1={[4, 0]} point2={[4, 4 + Math.sin(4)]} />
        <Line.Segment point1={[4.5, 0]} point2={[4.5, 4.5 + Math.sin(4.5)]} />
        <Line.Segment point1={[4, 4 + Math.sin(4)]} point2={[4.5, 4 + Math.sin(4)]} />

        <LaTeX tex="\text{d}x" at={[4.25, -0.2]} />
        <LaTeX tex="f'(x)\, \text{d}x" at={[5.2, 4.25 + Math.sin(4)]} />
    </Mafs>

3. Both of these represent the same thing: the change in $f$ as we move from $a$ to $b$.
    The first is a direct calculation, while the second sums up individual changes along the curve.
    Since they are equivalent, we can say:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \int_a^b f'(x) \dd{x} = f(b) - f(a)
    \end{equation}
    $$

    This is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

## Intuition for the Gradient Theorem

Consider a scalar field $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$.
Just like in single-variable calculus, we can think of moving along a curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Denote the starting point as $\va{a}$ and the ending point as $\va{b}$, and the curve we move along as $C$.
We can think of the curve as a parametric curve $\va{r}(t)$, where $t$ is the parameter that moves us along the curve.

1. The change in $f$ as we move along the curve (from $\va{a}$ to $\va{b}$) can be represented as:

    $$
    f(\va{b}) - f(\va{a})
    $$

2. Alternatively, we can think of moving along the curve in small steps.

    In each step, we increment $t$ by a small amount $\dd{t}$, resulting in a small change in $\va{r}$, denoted as $\dd{\va{r}}$.
    The change in $f$ as we move along this small step can be represented as a directional derivative:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \dd{f} = \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Next, we sum up all these changes along the curve:

    $$
    \int_C \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}}
    $$

3. Finally, we can say that both of these represent the same thing: the change in $f$ as we move along the curve.
    Since they are equivalent, we can say:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \int_C \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}} = f(\va{b}) - f(\va{a})
    \end{equation}
    $$

    This equation is known as the fundamental theorem of line integrals, or the gradient theorem.

We can also express it in terms of $t$ instead of $\va{r}$.
Denote $\va{a} = \va{r}(a)$ and $\va{b} = \va{r}(b)$.
Then, we can write the integral as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b \grad{f} \cdot \va{r}'(t) \dd{t} = f(\va{r}(b)) - f(\va{r}(a))
\end{equation}
$$

## Proof By Multivariable Chain Rule

To prove the gradient theorem, we will use the multivariable chain rule.

Consider the derivative of the composition $f(\va{r}(t))$. By the chain rule, this is:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{t} f(\va{r}(t)) = \grad{f} \cdot \va{r}'(t)
\end{equation}
$$

Looks familiar? Plug this into the integral:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b \class{blue}{\grad{f} \cdot \va{r}'(t)} \dd{t} = \int_a^b \class{blue}{\dv{t} f(\va{r}(t))} \dd{t}
\end{equation}
$$

The right-hand side can be evaluated simply by the regular fundamental theorem:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b \dv{t} f(\va{r}(t)) \dd{t} = f(\va{r}(b)) - f(\va{r}(a))
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, we have proven the gradient theorem.

## Implications: Path Independence

One of the most important implications of the gradient theorem is the concept of path independence.

Consider two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ that start and end at the same points $\va{a}$ and $\va{b}$.

By the gradient theorem, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_{C_1} \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}} = f(\va{b}) - f(\va{a}) = \int_{C_2} \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}}
\end{equation}
$$

This means that the value of the line integral of $\grad{f}$ along any curve from $\va{a}$ to $\va{b}$ is the same.
In other words, the line integral of $\grad{f}$ is **path independent**.

This should be a surprising result - it means that no matter where you start and end, the total change in $f$ is always the same.

This property is crucial in the study of conservative vector fields, which we will explore in the next section.

## Summary and Next Steps

In this section, we introduced the fundamental theorem of line integrals, also known as the gradient theorem:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_C \grad{f} \cdot \dd{\va{r}} = f(\va{b}) - f(\va{a})
\end{equation}
$$

And in terms of $t$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b \grad{f} \cdot \va{r}'(t) \dd{t} = f(\va{r}(b)) - f(\va{r}(a))
\end{equation}
$$

Here are the key points to remember:

- The gradient theorem extends the fundamental theorem of calculus to line integrals.
- It states that the line integral of the gradient of a function is equal to the change in the function between the endpoints of the curve.
- This theorem has important implications, such as path independence.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of conservative vector fields, which are closely related to the gradient theorem.
