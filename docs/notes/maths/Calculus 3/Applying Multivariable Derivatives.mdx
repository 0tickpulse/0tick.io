# Applying Multivariable Derivatives

Previously, we covered a lot of the theory behind multivariable derivatives, starting from the partial derivatives, the gradient, and the directional derivative, and ending with the Jacobian matrix.
Now we will look at how to apply these concepts to solve some problems.

## Tangent Planes of Graphs

Recall from single-variable calculus that we can use a tangent line to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.
Given a point $x_0$ on a curve $f(x)$, the tangent line at $x_0$ is given by the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
y = \dv{f}{x}(x_0)(x - x_0) + f(x_0)
\end{equation}
$$

We can extend this idea to multivariable functions.
Instead of a tangent line, we use a tangent *plane* to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.
