# Gradient

The gradient of a function is a collection of all its partial derivatives.

For a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, the gradient is denoted by $\grad f$.
The symbol $\nabla$ is called "nabla" or "del", although "del" refers more to the operator instead of the actual symbol.
The formula for the gradient is:

$$
\begin{equation}
\grad f(x_1, y_1, \dots) = \mqty[ \pdv{f}{x}(x_1, y_1, \dots) \\ \pdv{f}{y}(x_1, y_1, \dots) \\ \vdots ]
\end{equation}
$$

Alternatively, the gradient can be written as a summation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\grad f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \pdv{f}{x_i} \vu{e}_i
\end{equation}
$$

Where $\vu{e}_i$ is the $i$th unit vector ($\vu{i}$, $\vu{j}$, etc.).

The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the greatest increase of the function.

## Properties

The gradient can be thought of as the multivariable analog of the derivative.
Therefore it has similar properties to the derivative.

### Linearity

The gradient is a linear operator. This means that for any two functions $f$ and $g$ and any scalar $c$, the following holds:

$$
\begin{equation}
\grad (cf + g) = c \grad f + \grad g
\end{equation}
$$
