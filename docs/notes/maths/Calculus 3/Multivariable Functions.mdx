# Multivariable Functions

Multivariable functions are functions that take multiple inputs and produce a single output.

A single-variable function might look like $f(x) = x^2$, where the input is a single number $x$ and the output is $x^2$. A multivariable function might look like $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, where the input is two numbers $x$ and $y$ and the output is $x^2 + y^2$.
