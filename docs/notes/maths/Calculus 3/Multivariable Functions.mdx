# Multivariable Functions

Multivariable functions are functions that take multiple inputs and produce a single output.

A single-variable function might look like $f(x) = x^2$, where the input is a single number $x$ and the output is $x^2$. A multivariable function might look like $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, where the input is two numbers $x$ and $y$ and the output is $x^2 + y^2$.

## Inputs to Multivariable Functions

The inputs to a function are called the **domain** of the function. The domain is the set of all possible inputs that the function can take.
This can be extended to multivariable functions. For example, the domain of the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ is all pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$,
while the domain of the function $f(x, y) = \ln(x + y)$ is all pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$ such that $x + y > 0$.

## Outputs of Multivariable Functions

The output of a function is called the **range** of the function. The range is the set of all possible outputs that the function can produce.

Multivariable functions can output single numbers, but sometimes they can also output vectors, matrices, or other more complex objects.

For example, this function outputs a vector:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} x^2 \\ y^2 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

This function outputs a matrix:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} x & y \\ y & x \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

## Visualizing Multivariable Functions

Multivariable functions can be visualized in a few different ways.
Unlike single-variable functions, graphs might not be sufficiently expressive to capture the behavior of a multivariable function.

### Graphing

One way to visualize a multivariable function is to graph it in three dimensions.
In a 2D graph, you have $x$ as the horizontal axis, which usually represents the input, and $y$ as the vertical axis, which represents the output.

Conventionally, in a 3D graph, you have $x$ and $y$ as the horizontal and vertical axes, and $z$ as the axis that represents the output.
The $x$ and $y$ axes correspond to the input, and the $z$ axis corresponds to the output.

This also shows that, instead of a line of inputs, now you have an entire plane of inputs.

### Contour Plots

Sometimes it is difficult to visualize a 3D graph.
For example, the graph might be difficult to view on a computer screen or in a printed document,
or you don't have access to some software that can plot 3D graphs.

One alternative is to use a contour plot. A contour plot is a 2D plot that shows the function's output as a series of contours.
A contour plot can be thought of as a top-down view of the 3D graph.
Each contour line represents a different output value, and the closer the lines are together, the steeper the function is at that point.

One common example of a contour plot is a topographic map, which shows the elevation of the land as a series of contour lines.
