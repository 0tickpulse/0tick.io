  Applying multivariable derivatives to solve problems.

  Previously, we covered a lot of the theory behind multivariable derivatives, starting from the partial derivatives, the gradient, and the directional derivative, and ending with the Jacobian matrix.
  Now we will look at how to apply these concepts to solve some problems, such as approximations and optimization.
