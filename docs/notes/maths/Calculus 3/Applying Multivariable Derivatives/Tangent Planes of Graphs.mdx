# Tangent Planes of Graphs

Recall from single-variable calculus that we can use a tangent line to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.
Given a point $x_0$ on a curve $f(x)$, the tangent line at $x_0$ is given by the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
y = \dv{f}{x}(x_0)(x - x_0) + f(x_0)
\end{equation}
$$

We can extend this idea to multivariable functions.
Instead of a tangent line, we use a tangent *plane* to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.

Before even attempting to find the tangent plane, let's explore 3D planes a bit more to build some intuition.

## Understanding and Controlling 3D Planes in Space

There are many ways to represent a plane in 3D space.
We have [previously explored planes in the context of linear algebra](/notes/maths/Linear%20Algebra/Vectors%20Part%202#equation-of-a-plane-in-r3), where a plane is defined by a normal vector and a point, i.e. $\va{n} \cdot (\va{r} - \va{r}_0) = 0$.

Let the plane be a function of $x$ and $y$:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = ?
\end{equation}
$$

Consider a point in 3D space, $(1, 2, 3)$.
Then, consider a plane $L(x, y)$ such that the plane passes through the point $(1, 2, 3)$.
There could be many such planes, so we will need to specify more information to uniquely determine the plane.

export function Plane3DGraph() {
    const a = 3;
    const b = 3;
    const c = 3;
    const d = 9;

    const [slice, setSlice] = useState("x") // "x", "y", "none";
    const [slicePoint, setSlicePoint] = useState(1);
    const [showSlicedLine, setShowSlicedLine] = useState(true);

    function z(x, y) {
        return (d - a * x - b * y) / c;
    }

<Plane3DGraph />

The first property of this plane function, is that it must pass through the point $(1, 2, 3)$. This can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(1, 2) = 3
\end{equation}
$$

Next, consider the slope of the plane. If we slice the plane along the $x$-axis, we will see a line, and likewise for the $y$-axis (check above for a visualization).
This can then be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align}
\dv{L}{x}(x, y) &= a \\
\dv{L}{y}(x, y) &= b
\end{align}
$$

Where $a$ is some arbitrary constant. We can use these equations to try to get the equation for the plane.

First, consider the first equation $\dv{L}{x}(x, y) = a$. This means that $L$ is equal to $ax$ plus something that doesn't depend on $x$:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = ax + f(y)
\end{equation}
$$

Likewise, the second equation $\dv{L}{y}(x, y) = b$ means that $L$ is equal to $by$ plus something that doesn't depend on $y$:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = by + g(x)
\end{equation}
$$

Combining these two equations, we would get something like:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = ax + by + c
\end{equation}
$$

What should $c$ be? We know that $L(1, 2) = 3$, so we can substitute these values in:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(1, 2) = a + 2b + c = 3
\end{equation}
$$

This gives us a system of equations that we can solve to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. For example, given these following slopes:

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{L}{x}(x, y) = 2 \\
\dv{L}{y}(x, y) = 1
\end{equation}
$$

Then, we can find the equation of the plane:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = 2x + y + c
\end{equation}
$$

Given that $L(1, 2) = 3$, we can plug in these values to find $c$:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(1, 2) = 2 + 2 + c = 3 \implies c = -1
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, the equation of the plane is:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = 2x + y - 1
\end{equation}
$$

Another way to think about this is through some function transformation. Going back to what we had:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = ax + by + c, \quad L(1, 2) = 3
\end{equation}
$$

Let's rewrite $L$ using the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = a(x - \class{blue}{1}) + b(y - \class{yellow}{2}) + k, \quad L(\class{blue}{1}, \class{yellow}{2}) = 3
\end{equation}
$$

Where $k$ is a new constant. This is equivalent to the previous equation (the partial derivatives are the same), but once we plug in $(1, 2)$, we get:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(1, 2) = a(1 - 1) + b(2 - 2) + k = k = 3
\end{equation}
$$

Meaning that $k = 3$. We can generalize this. Given a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, and the slopes $\dv{L}{x} = a$ and $\dv{L}{y} = b$, the equation of the plane is:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + z_0
\end{equation}
$$

This is essentially the 3D equivalent of the slope-intercept form of a line, $y = mx + b$.

## Computing the Tangent Plane

Now that we have a better understanding of 3D planes, let's compute the tangent plane of a function $f(x, y)$ at a point $(\class{blue}{x_0}, \class{yellow}{y_0}, \class{green}{f(x_0, y_0)})$.

The tangent plane can be defined using the slopes of the function at that point, and the point itself. Hence, the equation of the tangent plane is:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = \pdv{f(x_0, y_0)}{x}(x - \class{blue}{x_0}) + \pdv{f(x_0, y_0)}{y}(y - \class{yellow}{y_0}) + \class{green}{f(x_0, y_0)} \label{eq:computing_the_tangent_plane}
\end{equation}
$$

This is the 3D equivalent of the tangent line in single-variable calculus.

Notice that the first two terms resemble a dot product between the gradient of the function and the vector $(x - x_0, y - y_0)$.
If we set $\va{r} = (x, y)$ and $\va{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0)$, then the equation of the tangent plane can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(\va{r}) = \grad f(\va{r}_0) \cdot (\va{r} - \va{r}_0) + f(\va{r}_0) \label{eq:computing_the_tangent_plane-vector-form}
\end{equation}
$$

Which is even closer to the slope-intercept form of a line:

$$
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{L(\va{r})}_{y} = \underbrace{\grad f(\va{r}_0)}_{m} \cdot \underbrace{(\va{r} - \va{r}_0)}_{x} + \underbrace{f(\va{r}_0)}_{b}
\end{equation}
$$

## Linearity of Tangent Planes

A linear function, for this context, is a function that can be written in the form $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n$.
In other words, the output of the function is a linear combination of the inputs.

Usually, the input of the function is collected into a vector like $\va{x} = \mqty[x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n]$.
The output is then written as a dot product of that vector with a coefficient vector:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(\va{x}) = \va{a} \cdot \va{x}
\end{equation}
$$

In a tangent plane, however, we add a constant term to the linear function.
Now the output is a linear combination of the inputs plus a constant:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(\va{x}) = \va{a} \cdot \va{x} + b
\end{equation}
$$

This is no longer a linear function, but an **affine** function.

## Local Linearization

Recall, in single-variable calculus, that the tangent line is used to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.

In this case, we can do the same.
Suppose we have a nonlinear function $f(\va{x})$.
We can approximate the function near a point $\va{x}_0$ using a tangent plane.

Recall from Equation $\eqref{eq:computing_the_tangent_plane-vector-form}$ that the equation of the tangent plane is:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(\va{x}) = \grad f(\va{x}_0) \cdot (\va{x} - \va{x}_0) + f(\va{x}_0)
\end{equation}
$$

And as such, this can be used to approximate the function $f(\va{x})$ near the point $\va{x}_0$.

## Example Problem: Tangent Plane of a Multivariable Function

> The function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ is given. Find the equation of the tangent plane at the point $(1, 2, 5)$.

To find the equation of the tangent plane, we need to find the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$ at the point $(1, 2)$:

$$
\begin{align}
\pdv{f}{x} &= 2x \\
\pdv{f}{y} &= 2y
\end{align}
$$

Plugging in the values $(1, 2)$, we get:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{f}{x}(1, 2) = \class{blue}{2} \quad \pdv{f}{y}(1, 2) = \class{yellow}{4}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, the equation of the tangent plane is as follows, using the point $(\class{green}{1}, \class{red}{2}, \class{purple}{5})$:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(x, y) = \class{blue}{2}(x - \class{green}{1}) + \class{yellow}{4}(y - \class{red}{2}) + \class{purple}{5}
\end{equation}
$$

## Example Problem: Approximating an Expression

> Solve for an approximate value for the following expression:
>
> $$\sqrt{2.01 + \sqrt{0.99 + \sqrt{9.01}}}$$
>
> [(Source)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/tangent-planes-and-local-linearization/a/local-linearization)

To solve this problem, we need to find a function that approximates the given expression. Let's define the function as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}
\end{equation}
$$

Recall that, to find the local linearization of a function, we need:

1. The value of $f(x_0, y_0, z_0)$
2. The partial derivatives of $f(x, y, z)$ at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$

We can set $x_0 = 2$, $y_0 = 1$, and $z_0 = 9$, a close approximation to the values in the expression.
Then, we can find the value of the function at $(2, 1, 9)$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f(2, 1, 9) &= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{9}}} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{1 + 3}} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{2 + 2} \\
&= 2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

This itself serves as a close approximation to the original expression, but we can get closer!
Next, we need to find the partial derivatives of $f(x, y, z)$ at $(2, 1, 9)$, the easiest of which is $\pdv{f}{x}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{f}{x} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + \sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}}
\end{equation}
$$

For the other partial derivatives, we need to use the chain rule to find the derivatives of the inner functions:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{f}{y} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + \sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, for $\pdv{f}{z}$, another application of the chain rule is needed:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pdv{f}{z} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + \sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}} \cdot \frac{1}{2\sqrt{z}}
\end{equation}
$$

We have three components in these partial derivatives. Evaluating them one by one at $(2, 1, 9)$:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x + \sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}}} &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{9}}}} &&= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{1 + 3}}} &= \frac{1}{4} \\
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y + \sqrt{z}}} &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{9}}} &&= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1 + 3}} &= \frac{1}{4} \\
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{z}} &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{9}} &&= \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
$$

Hence the partial derivatives at $(2, 1, 9)$ are:

$$
\begin{align}
\pdv{f}{x}(2, 1, 9) &= \frac{1}{4} \\
\pdv{f}{y}(2, 1, 9) &= \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16} \\
\pdv{f}{z}(2, 1, 9) &= \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{96}
\end{align}
$$

Recall the equation of the tangent plane for local linearization:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(\va{x}) = \pdv{f}{x}(\va{x_0})(x - x_0) + \pdv{f}{y}(\va{x_0})(y - y_0) + \pdv{f}{z}(\va{x_0})(z - z_0) + f(\va{x_0})
\end{equation}
$$

Plugging in the values, we get:

$$
\begin{equation}
L(\va{x}) = \frac{1}{4}(x - 2) + \frac{1}{16}(y - 1) + \frac{1}{96}(z - 9) + 2
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, using the values $x = 2.01$, $y = 0.99$, and $z = 9.01$, we can find the approximate value of the expression:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L(2.01, 0.99, 9.01) &= \frac{1}{4}(2.01 - 2) + \frac{1}{16}(0.99 - 1) + \frac{1}{96}(9.01 - 9) + 2 \\
&= \frac{1}{4}(0.01) + \frac{1}{16}(-0.01) + \frac{1}{96}(0.01) + 2 \\
&= \frac{0.01}{4} - \frac{0.01}{16} + \frac{0.01}{96} + 2 \\
&= 0.0025 - 0.000625 + 0.0001041667 + 2 \\
&= 2.0019791667
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Thus, the approximate value of the expression is $2.0019791667$.

:::info The Actual Value

The actual value for the expression is $2.0019778882$. The approximation is very close (within $0.0000012785$), showing the power of local linearization in approximating functions.

## Summary

We have explored the concept of tangent planes in 3D space, and how they can be used to approximate the behavior of a function near a point.

- The equation of a plane in 3D space can be written as $L(x, y) = ax + by + c$.
    - $a$ and $b$ are the slopes of the plane along the $x$ and $y$ axes respectively.
    - $c$ is a constant that determines the height of the plane.
- The equation of the tangent plane of a function $f(x, y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, f(x_0, y_0))$ is given by:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    L(x, y) = \pdv{f(x_0, y_0)}{x}(x - x_0) + \pdv{f(x_0, y_0)}{y}(y - y_0) + f(x_0, y_0)
    \end{equation}
    $$

- The equation of the tangent plane can also be written in vector form as:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    L(\va{r}) = \grad f(\va{r}_0) \cdot (\va{r} - \va{r}_0) + f(\va{r}_0)
    \end{equation}
    $$

- The tangent plane is an affine function, not a linear function.
- The tangent plane can be used to approximate the behavior of a function near a point, a concept known as local linearization.

Next, we will learn about quadratic approximations, another method to approximate functions near a point.
Eventually, we will generalize even further to the Multivariable Taylor Series, which can approximate functions to any degree near a point.
