# Extending the Derivative

We have seen how to differentiate functions of one variable, but what about functions of multiple variables?
We've already seen that functions can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and they appear frequently in the real world.
In this section, we will extend the concept of the derivative to functions of multiple variables.

## Overview

First, we discuss the partial derivative, which is the derivative of a function with respect to one of its variables, holding the other variables constant.
We extend some of our rules from single-variable calculus to partial derivatives, one of which is the chain rule.
We introduce second partial derivatives, and touch on the symmetry of mixed partial derivatives.

Next, we discuss the gradient of a function, which from the surface looks like a vector of partial derivatives.
However, through the concept of the directional derivative, we gain deeper insight into the physical meaning of the gradient.

After that, we take a detour into a concept called curvature, and fully go through its lengthy derivation.
On the way, we learn important concepts like the tangent vector and arc lengths, which are crucial for other topics in multivariable calculus.

With the groundwork laid, we move on to some higher-level constructs. We introduce the divergence, curl, and Laplacian operators, and take a look at their applications through understanding Maxwell's equations.

Finally, we discuss the concept of the Jacobian, which is a generalization of the derivative to functions of multiple variables.
