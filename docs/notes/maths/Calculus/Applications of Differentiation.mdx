# Applications of Differentiation

Differentiation is a powerful tool in mathematics, and it has many applications in real life.

## Modeling Motion

One of the most common applications of differentiation is in modeling motion. To take a very simple example, consider a ball moving along some trajectory.

The height of the ball at time $t$ can be modeled by $s(t)$.

With differentiation, we can find the velocity of the ball at any time $t$ by taking the derivative of $s(t)$ with respect to $t$.

Similarly, we can find the acceleration of the ball at any time $t$ by taking the derivative of the velocity function with respect to $t$.

$$
\begin{align*}
s(t) &= 5t^2 + 3t + 2 \tag{For example} \\
v(t) &= \frac{ds}{dt} = 10t + 3 \\
a(t) &= \frac{dv}{dt} = 10
\end{align*}
$$
