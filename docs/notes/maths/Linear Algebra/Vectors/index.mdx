## Overview

This is a rather short part of the notes, as it just provides a basic conceptual introduction to vectors.
We will begin by discussing what vectors are, and how they can be represented in different ways.

Then, we will discuss the operations that define vectors, such as addition and scalar multiplication.

Finally, we will discuss some concepts related to vector spaces, such as linear independence and basis vectors.
