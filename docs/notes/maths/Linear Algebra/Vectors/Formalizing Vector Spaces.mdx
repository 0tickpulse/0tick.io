# Formalizing Vector Spaces

Previously, we discussed what vectors are and how they can be represented in different ways.
We looked at the operations that define vectors, such as addition and scalar multiplication, as well as some concepts related to vector spaces, such as linear independence and basis vectors.

In this section, we will formalize the concept of a vector space.
We will define what a vector space is, and discuss some of its properties.

## What Even is a Vector?

We need to start by defining what a vector even is.
This is surprisingly difficult, as vectors can be defined in many different ways - so which one is the "right" one, or the most fundamental one?

It seems that our current interpretations of vectors do not capture the essence of what a vector truly is:

1. **Arrows in Space**: This representation provides a geometric intuition for vectors, but it is not the most general definition.
    They cannot represent vectors in higher dimensions, or vectors in more abstract spaces.
2. **Ordered Lists of Numbers**: This representation seems more general, as it can represent vectors in any dimension.
    However, when we define vectors this way, we are implicitly assuming a set of basis vectors.
    This is a problem, since vectors themselves should be independent of any coordinate system or basis.

The most general definition of a vector is as an **element of a vector space**.

## Vector Spaces

A **vector space** is a set of objects, called **vectors**, that can be added together and multiplied by scalars.
These operations must satisfy a set of properties. These properties are definitions of what it means to be a vector space, and as such, are known as the **axioms** that define a vector space.

<details>
<summary>Axioms of a Vector Space</summary>

These axioms are put in this dropdown to emphasize that they are not important to memorize at all.

Here is a list of these properties, assuming that $\va{u}$, $\va{v}$, and $\va{w}$ are vectors, and $a$ and $b$ are scalars:

| Property | Statement |
|----------|-----------|
| **Addition Associativity** | $\va{u} + (\va{v} + \va{w}) = (\va{u} + \va{v}) + \va{w}$ |
| **Addition Commutativity** | $\va{u} + \va{v} = \va{v} + \va{u}$ |
| **Additive Identity** | There exists a vector $\va{0}$ such that $\va{u} + \va{0} = \va{u}$ |
| **Additive Inverse** | For every vector $\va{u}$, there exists a vector $-\va{u}$ such that $\va{u} + (-\va{u}) = \va{0}$ |
| **Scalar Multiplication Associativity** | $a(b\va{u}) = (ab)\va{u}$ |
| **Scalar Multiplication Identity** | $1\va{u} = \va{u}$ |
| **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Vector Addition** | $a(\va{u} + \va{v}) = a\va{u} + a\va{v}$ |
| **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Scalar Addition** | $(a + b)\va{u} = a\va{u} + b\va{u}$ |

Think of these properties as the "rules" that vectors must follow in order to be considered vectors.

As an exercise, consider our previous definitions of vectors, whether as arrows or as lists of numbers, and check if they satisfy these properties.
Additionally, consider why these properties make sense to be used as the axioms of a vector space.

Of course, do not memorize these properties - they are not meant to be memorized, but rather *understood* at a fundamental level.

### Real Coordinate System

In our visualizations, we deal with vectors in a real coordinate system.
This coordinate system is a vector space, as it allows for addition and scalar multiplication.

Consider how we can define a real coordinate system more formally.
In an $n$-dimensional real coordinate system, a vector is an ordered list of $n$ real numbers.
Thus, we can use the set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers as our vector space:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{R}^n = \qty{ \mqty[x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n] \mid x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb{R} }
\end{equation}
$$

## Linear Subspaces

Consider a set $V$ that is a vector space. That is, it allows for addition and scalar multiplication, and satisfies the properties of a vector space.
For the sake of simplicity, let's visualize this $V$ as a coordinate plane:

<Mafs>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
</Mafs>

Now, imagine taking a chunk of this plane so that you have a smaller group of vectors within it.
For example, let's consider the vectors that lie on a line passing through the origin:

<Mafs>
    <Coordinates.Cartesian />
    <Plot.OfX y={(x) => 0.4 * x} color={color("blue")} />
</Mafs>

Assume we have some set of vectors that lie on this line.
If we perform operations on these vectors, such as addition and scalar multiplication, will the resulting vectors still lie on the line?
In other words, will operating on these vectors cause them to "leak out" of the line?

If the resulting vectors still line on the line, then we say that the line is a **linear subspace** of the vector space.
To assess whether our line is a linear subspace, let's think about it from a visual context:

1. If you add two vectors on the line, the resulting vector will still lie on the line.
2. If you multiply a vector on the line by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie on the line, since the direction of the vector does not change.

Therefore, we can say that this line is a linear subspace of the vector space.

A consequence of something being a linear subspace is that it itself is also a vector space.
In a sense, a linear subspace is a "mini" vector space within a larger vector space.

### The Formal Definition

As we said, a linear subspace has the property that if you take any two vectors in the subspace and add them together, the resulting vector will still be in the subspace.
Whenever we have an operation that keeps an object within its own set, we call that operation **closed**.
In this case, the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are closed on the subspace.

Think about scalar multiplication for a moment. If you multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector will still lie in the subspace.
This scalar can be $0$, which means that all subspaces *must* contain the zero vector.

This leads us to the formal definition of a linear subspace:

<Boxed>
The set $W$ is a **linear subspace** of the vector space $V$ if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Closure under Addition**: For any vectors $\va{u}$ and $\va{v}$ in $W$, the vector $\va{u} + \va{v}$ is also in $W$.
2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: For any vector $\va{u}$ in $W$ and any scalar $a$, the vector $a\va{u}$ is also in $W$.
3. (Implicit) **Contains the Zero Vector**: The zero vector $\va{0}$ is in $W$.

</Boxed>

### Defining Linear Subspaces with a Basis

Suppose we have a set of vectors - any set of vectors will do - and we want to determine if their *span* form a linear subspace.
Recall that the span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors.

Let's consider a set of vectors $S = { \va{v}_1, \va{v}_2, \dots, \va{v}_n }$ and consider their span.
If the span of $S$ forms a linear subspace, then it must satisfy the properties of a linear subspace.
We can go through the properties of a linear subspace and check if the span satisfies them:

1. **Closure under Addition**: If we take any two vectors in the span and add them together, the resulting vector must still be in the span.
    This is true, since the span contains *all possible* linear combinations of the vectors.
    When we add two linear combinations, we simply get another linear combination.

2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: If we take any vector in the span and multiply it by a scalar, the resulting vector must still be in the span.
    This is also true, since the span contains all possible linear combinations.
    When we multiply a linear combination by a scalar, we get another linear combination.

3. **Contains the Zero Vector**: The span of any set of vectors *must* contain the zero vector.
    This is because the zero vector is itself a linear combination of the vectors in the set.

Therefore, we can say that:

<Boxed>
For any set of vectors $S = { \va{v}_1, \va{v}_2, \dots, \va{v}_n }$, the span of $S$ forms a linear subspace.
</Boxed>

This means that we can define a linear subspace simply by specifying a set of vectors that span it.
In order for it to not have any redundant vectors, we can choose a set of vectors that are linearly independent.
This set of vectors has a special name - it is called a **basis** for the subspace.
Then, we can define the subspace as the set of all possible linear combinations of the basis vectors.

<Boxed>
A set of vectors $S$ is a **basis** for a linear subspace $W$ if:

1. The vectors in $S$ are linearly independent.
2. The span of $S$ is $W$.
</Boxed>

### Why Bother with Linear Subspaces?

Unfortunately, with a concept as abstract as linear subspaces, it can be difficult to see why they are important.
This is a valid concern and should not be ignored, as it is crucial to understand the motivation behind learning these concepts.

Previously, we stated that linear subspaces are in a sense "mini" vector spaces.
This means that they also have the properties of vector spaces, meaning that we can perform operations on them just like we can on vector spaces.

When we define and formulate things in linear algebra, a lot of things are related to linear subspaces.
For instance, when we solve a system of linear equations, we get a subspace as the solution set.
This also includes topics we haven't covered yet, such as eigenspaces, the images of linear transformations, and a lot of other things, all of which *are* linear subspaces.

## Summary and Next Steps

In this section, we took what we know about vectors and formalized it into the concept of a vector space.

Here are the key points to remember:

- A vector space is a set of objects that can be added together and multiplied by scalars.
- More formally speaking, a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfies a set of properties, known as the axioms of a vector space.
- A linear subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space.
- Linear subspaces allow you to perform operations on a subset of vectors without them "leaking out" of the subset.
- Linear subspaces can be defined by specifying a set of vectors that span them, known as a basis.

In the next section, we will temporary leave the world of vectors and dive into the world of matrices.
This will allow us to understand a very fundamental concept in linear algebra - linear transformations.
With a solid grasp of linear transformations, we will then return to vectors and explore more topics, such as dot products, cross products, and more.
Armed with the knowledge of these transformations, these topics have a much deeper meaning and significance.

## Appendix

### Proof that Linear Subspaces are Vector Spaces

We stated that linear subspaces are themselves vector spaces.
Here's a short proof to show why this is the case; we will check the axioms of a vector space one by one.

In a linear subspace, the algebraic properties of addition and scalar multiplication are inherited from the parent vector space.
Thus, we only need to check the axioms that are less obvious.

1. **Additive Identity**: All linear subspaces, by definition, contain the zero vector. ✅
2. **Additive Inverse**: For any vector $\va{u}$ in the subspace, (since subspaces are closed under scalar multiplication) $-1 \cdot \va{u}$ is also in the subspace. ✅

Next, consider whether the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are defined on the subspace.
Since subspaces are closed under these operations, any time you add two vectors or multiply a vector by a scalar, the resulting vector will still be in the subspace.
Thus, these operations are perfectly valid and defined on the subspace.

In conclusion, linear subspaces are indeed vector spaces.
