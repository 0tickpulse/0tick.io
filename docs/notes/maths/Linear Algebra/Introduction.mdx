# Introduction

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. It is a fundamental branch of mathematics that has applications in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering.

Unfortunately, this is a notorious subject for being taught extremely poorly in schools and universities.
This is because it is often taught as a series of RiGOroUS dEfINitiOnS and ThEOReMs without any motivation or intuition behind them.
Of course, rigor is important, but it is often overemphasized at the expense of understanding.
