# Introduction

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. It is a fundamental branch of mathematics that has applications in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering.

## Goal

Almost every concept in linear algebra can be understood by visualizing it.
I aim to provide both visual explanations and algebraic explanations for each concept.

Both are important because visualizations help you understand the concept intuitively, while algebraic explanations ensures its rigor and correctness.
