# Introduction

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. It is a fundamental branch of mathematics that has applications in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering.

## Goal

Almost every concept in linear algebra can be understood by visualizing it.
I aim to provide both visual explanations and algebraic explanations for each concept.

Both are important because visualizations help you understand the concept intuitively, while algebraic explanations ensures its rigor and correctness.

Besides, I also want to provide insight as to why each concept is important and how it is used in real-world applications.
For instance, game developers use linear algebra to create realistic graphics, while physicists use it to model physical systems.
