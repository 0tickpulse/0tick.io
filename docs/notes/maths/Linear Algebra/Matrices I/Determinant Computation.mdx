# Determinant: Computation

Previously, we discussed the concept of the determinant of a matrix and its geometric interpretation.
In this section, we will learn how to compute the determinant of a matrix, which is a crucial skill in linear algebra.

## 2D Determinant

Let's start by computing the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix.
Recall that the determinant represents how much the matrix scales the area of a parallelogram spanned by its columns.
In this case we can just perform simple geometric calculations to find the determinant.
