# Matrices

Outside of the vector, the matrix is the most fundamental building block of linear algebra.

## Overview

Just like the previous section on vectors, this is a short part of the notes that provides a basic conceptual introduction to matrices.

We will begin with a motivating example - linear transformations, and then use it to define matrix-vector multiplication.
(Usually it's done the other way around.)
We will visualize linear transformations in both 2D and 3D space, and show that all linear transformations can be represented by matrices.

Then, we will discuss how matrices can be combined together with matrix multiplication.
We will also explore some important properties of matrices, such as the determinant and the inverse.

After that, we will touch on some more abstract topics, such as the rank, null space, column space, and more.
