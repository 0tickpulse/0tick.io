# Composite Transformations

In the previous sections, we laid the groundwork for a visual understanding of transformations.
We learned how these transformations, due to their linearity (which we currently understand as preserving the origin, and lines staying parallel and evenly spaced), can be represented by matrices.
We walked through the process of applying these transformations to vectors, and we saw how the matrix-vector product is a way to apply a transformation to a vector.

In this section, we will explore how we can combine multiple transformations into a single transformation.

## Combining Transformations

Suppose we have two transformations, $R$ and $S$, that rotate and scale vectors, respectively.
If we apply $R$ to a vector, and then apply $S$ to the result, we will rotate the vector and then scale the result.

We can represent this process as a single transformation, $T$, that is the result of applying $S$ to the result of applying $R$.
This transformation $T$ is called the **composite transformation** of $R$ and $S$.

Recall that when we apply a transformation to a vector, we multiply the transformation matrix by the vector.
Suppose our transformation matrices are:

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{R} &= \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
\vb{S} &= \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Then, applying $R$ to a vector $\va{v}$ is equivalent to multiplying the matrix $\vb{R}$ by $\va{v}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
R(\va{v}) = \vb{R} \va{v} = \mqty[0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0] \va{v}
\end{equation}
$$

And then applying $S$ to the result is equivalent to multiplying the matrix $\vb{S}$ by the result:

$$
\begin{equation}
S(R(\va{v})) = \mqty[2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \qty(\mqty[0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0] \va{v})
\end{equation}
$$

We can combine these two matrices into a single matrix, $\vb{T}$, that represents the composite transformation of $R$ and $S$.
This matrix is the result of **matrix multiplication**, a new operation that we will explore in this section.

## Deriving the Composite Transformation Matrix

To summarize the previous section, we have two transformations, $R$ and $S$, with matrices $\vb{R}$ and $\vb{S}$.
To find the composite transformation matrix $\vb{T}$, we multiply the matrices $\vb{R}$ and $\vb{S}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{T} = \vb{S} \vb{R} \implies T(\va{v}) = \vb{T} \va{v} = \vb{S} \vb{R} \va{v} = \mqty[2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \qty(\mqty[0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0] \va{v})
\end{equation}
$$

Let's zoom in on the matrix multiplication step:

$$
\underbrace{\mqty[2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1]}_{\text{Scaling}} \underbrace{\mqty[0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0]}_{\text{Rotation}} = \mqty[? & ? \\ ? & ?]
$$

Recall that each column in the matrix represents the result of applying the transformation to the basis vectors.
So we just need to apply the transformation to the basis vectors and fill in the resulting columns of the matrix.

When we apply the rotation matrix, $\vb{R}$, we get that $\ihatc = \mqty[0 \\ -1]$ and $\jhatc = \mqty[1 \\ 0]$ (since the columns represent the transformed basis vectors).
Then, we can apply the scaling matrix, $\vb{S}$, to these vectors to get the columns of the composite transformation matrix:

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{S}\vb{R}\ihatc = \mqty[2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \mqty[0 \\ -1] &= \mqty[0 \\ -1] \\
\vb{S}\vb{R}\jhatc = \mqty[2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1] \mqty[1 \\ 0] &= \mqty[2 \\ 0]
\end{align}
$$

Then, these new vectors are the columns of the composite transformation matrix:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{T} = \mqty[\class{blue}{0} & \class{yellow}{2} \\ \class{blue}{-1} & \class{yellow}{0}]
\end{equation}
$$

Generalizing this process, let's say we have two transformations, $M_1$ and $M_2$, with matrices $\vb{M}_1$ and $\vb{M}_2$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{M}_1 = \mqty[a & b \\ c & d] \qquad \vb{M}_2 = \mqty[e & f \\ g & h]
\end{equation}
$$

Let's say we apply $M_1$ first, and then apply $M_2$.
Applying $M_1$ to the basis vectors gives us $\ihatc = \mqty[a \\ c]$ and $\jhatc = \mqty[b \\ d]$.
Then, applying $M_2$ to these vectors gives us the columns of the composite transformation matrix:

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{M}_2\vb{M}_1\ihatc &= \mqty[e & f \\ g & h] \mqty[a \\ c] = a\mqty[e \\ g] + c\mqty[f \\ h] = \mqty[ae + cf \\ ag + ch] \\
\vb{M}_2\vb{M}_1\jhatc &= \mqty[e & f \\ g & h] \mqty[b \\ d] = b\mqty[e \\ g] + d\mqty[f \\ h] = \mqty[be + df \\ bg + dh]
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, the composite transformation matrix is:

<Boxed>
$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{T} = \mqty[e & f \\ g & h] \mqty[a & b \\ c & d] = \mqty[ae + cf & be + df \\ ag + ch & bg + dh]
\end{equation}
$$
</Boxed>

Just as a memory aid, going from left to right, top to bottom, the composite transformation matrix can be calculated as:

- Row 1 (of left matrix), Column 1 (of right matrix): $e \cdot a + f \cdot c$
- Row 1, Column 2: $e \cdot b + f \cdot d$
- Row 2, Column 1: $g \cdot a + h \cdot c$
- Row 2, Column 2: $g \cdot b + h \cdot d$

Essentially, go through the rows of the left matrix, and for each row, go through the columns of the right matrix, multiplying the corresponding elements and summing them up.

However, understanding the process intuitively through the composition of linear transformations is far more important and insightful than rote memorization of the formula.
