# Formalizing Linear Transformations

In the previous sections, we introduced the concept of linear transformations and how they can be represented by matrices.
We explored everything in a visual manner, using 2D and 3D space to help us understand the transformations.

In this section, we will formalize the concept of linear transformations.

## Functions and Sets

Before we dive into linear transformations, let's first review some basic concepts from functions and sets.

A function is a rule that assigns each element in a set to exactly one element in another set.
For example, the function $f(x) = 2x$ assigns each real number $x$ to the real number $2x$.

We will need to understand some terminology related to functions:

- Every function has a **domain** and a **image** (or **range**), representing the set of possible inputs and possible outputs, respectively.
- The image lives in the **codomain**, which is the set in which the function outputs are contained.

We can draw a diagram to represent visually how a function maps elements from the domain to the range:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Domain"]
    subgraph "Codomain"
        B["Output (Image/Range)"]
    end
    A --> B
```

For example, consider the function $f(x) = x^2$:

- The domain is all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.
- The codomain is also all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$.
- The range is all non-negative real numbers, $[0, \infty)$.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Domain: R"]
    subgraph "Codomain: R"
        B["Output (Range): [0, ∞)"]
    end
    A --"f(x) = x²"--> B
```

We can notate the function $f$ as $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty)$, which reads as "$f$ maps from the real numbers to the non-negative real numbers".

## What Linear Transformations Really Are

Now, let's dive into linear transformations.
Linear transformations are a special kind of function; previously, we stated that they act on vectors.
For example, a linear transformation $T$ might take a 2D vector and output another 2D vector.
Then, we can write the transformation as $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$.

Recall that when we apply a linear transformation to a vector, if we express the vector as a linear combination of the basis vectors, the transformation can be applied to each basis vector separately.
Then, the coefficients of the linear combination are preserved.

For example, consider a linear transformation $T$ and a vector $\va{v} = a\ihatc + b\jhatc$.
Then, $T(\va{v}) = aT(\ihatc) + bT(\jhatc)$.
This is due to the linearity of the transformation, which we said means that the transformation:

- Preserves the origin.
- Preserves lines, which stay parallel and evenly spaced.

Let's see how we can formalize this. We start with a premise:

$$
\begin{equation}
T\qty(\mqty[a \\ b]) = aT(\ihatc) + bT(\jhatc)
\end{equation}
$$

We will go from this to the formal definition of a linear transformation.

Consider applying the transformation $T$ to the sum of two vectors $\va{v}$ and $\va{w}$, where $\va{v} = a\ihatc + b\jhatc$ and $\va{w} = c\ihatc + d\jhatc$.
Then:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T(\va{v} + \va{w}) = T\qty(\mqty[a + c \\ b + d]) &= (a + c)T(\ihatc) + (b + d)T(\jhatc) \\
&= aT(\ihatc) + cT(\ihatc) + bT(\jhatc) + dT(\jhatc) \\
&= T(\va{v}) + T(\va{w})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Additionally, consider applying the transformation $T$ to a scalar multiple of a vector, $\alpha \va{v}$, where $\va{v} = a\ihatc + b\jhatc$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
T(\alpha \va{v}) = T\qty(\mqty[\alpha a \\ \alpha b]) &= \alpha aT(\ihatc) + \alpha bT(\jhatc) \\
&= \alpha (aT(\ihatc) + bT(\jhatc)) \\
&= \alpha T(\va{v})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

So we have shown that a linear transformation $T$ satisfies the following properties:

1. $T(\va{v} + \va{w}) = T(\va{v}) + T(\va{w})$. This is called the **additivity** of the transformation.
2. $T(\alpha \va{v}) = \alpha T(\va{v})$. This is called the **homogeneity** of the transformation.

These properties are the formal definition of what it means for a transformation to be linear.

We can construct a formal definition of a linear transformation from these properties:

<Boxed>
The transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is linear if it satisfies the following properties:

1. **Additivity**: $T(\va{v} + \va{w}) = T(\va{v}) + T(\va{w})$ for all vectors $\va{v}, \va{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
2. **Homogeneity**: $T(\alpha \va{v}) = \alpha T(\va{v})$ for all vectors $\va{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and scalars $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.
</Boxed>

A good exercise is to consider our geometric understanding of linear transformations and see how it fits with this formal definition *without getting lost in the notation*.
Are the properties of additivity and homogeneity consistent with our understanding of how linear transformations behave geometrically (preserving the origin and lines)?

### Example Problem: Verifying Linearity of Composite Transformations

> Let $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and $S: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be two linear transformations.
> Prove that the composite transformation $S \circ T$ is also a linear transformation.

Before proving why it is true, let's first consider why it *should* be true.
A vector $\va{v}$, as previously mentioned, can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
When we apply the transformation $T$ to $\va{v}$, it changes the basis vectors, but keeps the coefficients the same.
Then, when we apply the transformation $S$ to the result, it changes the basis vectors again, but keeps the coefficients the same.

This means that overall, the composite transformation $S \circ T$ is equivalent to changing the basis vectors and keeping the coefficients the same, which is what a linear transformation does.
An example might help:

- Let $T = \mqty[1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2]$ and $S = \mqty[0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0]$, where $T$ scales the $y$-axis by 2 and $S$ rotates the plane by 90 degrees.
- Then, $T(\ihatc) = \ihatc$ and $T(\jhatc) = 2\jhatc$, meaning $T\qty(\mqty[a \\ b]) = a\ihatc + b(2\jhatc)$.
- Similarly, $S(\ihatc) = \jhatc$ and $S(\jhatc) = -\ihatc$, meaning $S\qty(T\qty(\mqty[a \\ b])) = a(-\ihatc) + b(2\jhatc)$.
- This is equivalent to a transformation that transforms the basis vectors to $-\ihatc$ and $2\jhatc$; $S \circ T = \mqty[0 & 2 \\ -1 & 0]$.

Now, let's prove this formally.

**Proof**: To prove that $S \circ T$ is a linear transformation, we need to show that it satisfies the properties of additivity and homogeneity.

1. **Additivity**: Let $\va{v}, \va{w} \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Then:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    (S \circ T)(\va{v} + \va{w}) &= S(T(\va{v} + \va{w})) \\
    &= S(T(\va{v}) + T(\va{w})) \\
    &= S(T(\va{v})) + S(T(\va{w})) \\
    &= (S \circ T)(\va{v}) + (S \circ T)(\va{w})
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Hence, $S \circ T$ satisfies the additivity property.

2. **Homogeneity**: Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\va{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Then:

    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    (S \circ T)(\alpha \va{v}) &= S(T(\alpha \va{v})) \\
    &= S(\alpha T(\va{v})) \\
    &= \alpha S(T(\va{v})) \\
    &= \alpha (S \circ T)(\va{v})
    \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    $$

    Hence, $S \circ T$ satisfies the homogeneity property.

Therefore, $S \circ T$ is a linear transformation. $\blacksquare$
