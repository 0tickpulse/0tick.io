# Dot Product: Applications

This is likely the last section of the miniseries on dot products.
In this section, we will explore some applications of the dot product in various fields.
We will begin with the more common applications, and then move on to some more less well-known ones.

## Physical Work

In Physics, there is a quantity called a force.
This force is a vector quantity; its magnitude is the strength of the force, and its direction is the direction in which the force is applied.
For example, if you push a box to the right, the force you apply is a vector pointing to the right.

When a force $\va{F}$ is applied to an object, it can move by a certain distance $\Delta \va{r}$.
The quantity, **work**, represents how much energy is transferred to the object by the force.
Thinking intuitively, if you push a box with the same force over a longer distance, you are giving it more energy.
Similarly, if you push a box with a stronger force over the same distance, you are also giving it more energy.

Thus, we can define work, $W$ as the product of the magnitudes of the force and distance, right?

$$
\begin{equation}
W \overset{?}{\equiv} \norm{\va{F}} \norm{\Delta \va{r}}
\end{equation}
$$

The problem with this definition is that it does not account for the direction of the force.
Imagine you are pushing a box in an upward-right direction against a wall.
The force you apply is in the upward-right direction, but the box only moves up.
In this case, **only the force component in the direction of the motion (up) contributes to the work done**.

        <LaTeX tex="\Delta \mathbf{\vec{r}}" at={[0.2, -0.5]} />
    </Transform>
</Mafs>

So, in reality, the work done is:

$$
\begin{equation}
W \equiv \norm{\va{F} \text{ projected onto } \Delta \va{r}} \norm{\Delta \va{r}}
\end{equation}
$$

But wait... that's just the dot product of the force and the distance vector:

<Boxed>
$$
\begin{equation}
W \equiv \va{F} \cdot \Delta \va{r}
\end{equation}
$$
</Boxed>

The work is an extremely important concept in Physics, and the dot product is the key to understanding it.
It's relevant to understanding how energy is transferred in various systems, which in turn is crucial for understanding the behavior of physical systems.

## Language

Recall that the dot product of two vectors $\va{v}$ and $\va{w}$ can be thought of as a measure of their similarity.
If the dot product is positive, the vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction.
If the dot product is negative, the vectors are pointing in roughly opposite directions.

This property of the dot product is used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to compare the similarity of two pieces of text.
For a simplified example, imagine we have three letters, "a", "b", and "c".
We can represent each word as a dimension in a 3D space, where the letter "a" is the vector $\va{a} = \mqty[1 \\ 0 \\ 0]$, "b" is $\va{b} = \mqty[0 \\ 1 \\ 0]$, and "c" is $\va{c} = \mqty[0 \\ 0 \\ 1]$.

Now, let's consider the words "abca" and "accb".

The word "abca" has two "a"s, one "b", and one "c".
Thus, we can represent it as $2\va{a} + \va{b} + \va{c} = \mqty[2 \\ 1 \\ 1]$.

Similarly, the word "accb" can be represented as $\va{a} + 2\va{c} + \va{b} = \mqty[1 \\ 1 \\ 2]$.

Then, their similarity can be calculated as the dot product of the two vectors:

$$
\begin{equation}
\text{abca} \cdot \text{accb} = \mqty[2 \\ 1 \\ 1] \cdot \mqty[1 \\ 1 \\ 2] = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 = 5
\end{equation}
$$

Of course, in real-world applications, the vectors are much higher-dimensional, and the words are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
For example, some plagiarism detection software use the dot product to compare the similarity of two pieces of text.
