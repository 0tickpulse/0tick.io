# Linear Transformations

A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors to vectors in a way that preserves the vector space structure.
In simpler terms, a linear transformation preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.
One way to conceptualize this is to think of a linear transformation as a function that stretches, compresses, rotates, or reflects vectors in a vector space.
The transformation has to preserve the structure of the space, which means that it cannot "tear" or "break" vectors in the process.

A result of this is that after applying a linear transformation, the gridlines in the vector space will remain parallel and evenly spaced.
This property is crucial in many applications of linear algebra, such as computer graphics, physics, and engineering.

A more formal way to define a linear transformation is to say that a function $T: V \to U$ is a linear transformation if it satisfies the following two properties:

1. **Additivity**: $T(\va{u} + \va{v}) = T(\va{u}) + T(\va{v})$ for all vectors $\va{u}, \va{v} \in V$.
2. **Homogeneity**: $T(c\va{v}) = cT(\va{v})$ for all vectors $\va{v} \in V$ and all scalars $c$.

## Conceptual Introduction

To understand linear transformations better, let's consider a simple example.

Consider a 2D vector space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, with the standard basis vectors $\vu{i} = \mqty[ 1 \\ 0 ]$ and $\vu{j} = \mqty[ 0 \\ 1 ]$.

To describe a linear transformation, we can't possibly describe how it affects every single vector in the space.
Instead, due to the linearity of the transformation, it suffices to describe how it affects the basis vectors.

So, if you know how it affects $\vu{i}$ and $\vu{j}$, you can figure out how it affects any vector in the space.

Consider a transformation that maps $\vu{i}$ to $\mqty[ 1 \\ 1 ]$ and $\vu{j}$ to $\mqty[ 1 \\ -1 ]$.
Let's first visualize this transformation:

{(() => {
    return (
        <LinearTransformationVisualizer
            to={{
                ihat: [1, 1],
                jhat: [1, -1]
            }}
        />
    )
})()}

Recall that a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors $\vu{i}$ and $\vu{j}$.
So, any vector $\va{v} = \mqty[ x \\ y ]$ can be written as $x\vu{i} + y\vu{j}$.

To find how the transformation affects $\va{v}$, we can find how it affects $\vu{i}$ and $\vu{j}$ and then combine the results.
For example, if $\va{v} = \mqty[ 2 \\ 3 ]$, then:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\va{v} &= 2\vu{i} + 3\vu{j} \\
T(\va{v}) &= 2T(\vu{i}) + 3T(\vu{j}) \\
&= 2\mqty[ 1 \\ 1 ] + 3\mqty[ 1 \\ -1 ] \\
&= \mqty[ 2 \\ 2 ] + \mqty[ 3 \\ -3 ] \\
&= \mqty[ 5 \\ -1 ]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Notice how we were able to find the transformation of $\va{v}$ by only knowing how the transformation affects the basis vectors.
This relies on the linearity of the transformation, which will be proven later.

## Matrix Representation

Since linear transformations are so important in linear algebra, it's useful to have a way to represent them in a more compact form.
This is where matrices come in.

Let $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a linear transformation that maps $\vu{i}$ to $\mqty[ a \\ b ]$ and $\vu{j}$ to $\mqty[ c \\ d ]$.
Then, the transformation can be represented by the matrix:

$$
\begin{equation}
T = \mqty[ \class{blue}{a} & \class{yellow}{c} \\ \class{blue}{b} & \class{yellow}{d} ]
\end{equation}
$$

The columns of the matrix represent the images of the basis vectors.
So, the first column represents $T(\vu{i})$ and the second column represents $T(\vu{j})$.

Recall that you can find the transformation of any vector by finding how the transformation affects the basis vectors and then combining the results.
So, for any vector $\va{v} = \mqty[ x \\ y ]$, the transformation of $\va{v}$ can be found by:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(\va{v}) = xT(\vu{i}) + yT(\vu{j}) = x\mqty[ \class{blue}{a} \\ \class{blue}{b} ] + y\mqty[ \class{yellow}{c} \\ \class{yellow}{d} ]
\end{equation}
$$

Another way to notate it is to have the matrix written before the vector:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(\va{v}) = \mqty[ \class{blue}{a} & \class{yellow}{c} \\ \class{blue}{b} & \class{yellow}{d} ] \mqty[ x \\ y ]
\end{equation}
$$

We can formulate a general equation for such transformation as:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(\va{v}) = \mqty[ \class{blue}{a} & \class{yellow}{c} \\ \class{blue}{b} & \class{yellow}{d} ] \mqty[ x \\ y ] = x\mqty[ \class{blue}{a} \\ \class{blue}{b} ] + y\mqty[ \class{yellow}{c} \\ \class{yellow}{d} ] = \mqty[ \class{blue}{a}x + \class{yellow}{c}y \\ \class{blue}{b}x + \class{yellow}{d}y ]
\end{equation}
$$

### Generalizing to Higher Dimensions

The concept of linear transformations, like basically everything in Linear Algebra, can be extended to higher dimensions.

For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, a linear transformation can be represented by a $3 \times 3$ matrix.

Let $T: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a linear transformation between two vector spaces of dimensions $m$ and $n$.
Then $T$ can be represented by an $n \times m$ matrix.

Each column will represent the image of the corresponding basis vector in the domain space.
This idea can be written as:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(\va{v}) = \mqty[ {a_{1,1}} & {a_{1,2}} & \cdots & {a_{1,m}} \\ {a_{2,1}} & {a_{2,2}} & \cdots & {a_{2,m}} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ {a_{n,1}} & {a_{n,2}} & \cdots & {a_{n,m}} ] \mqty[ v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_m ]
\end{equation}
$$

Where the $a_{i,j}$ are the elements of the matrix representing the transformation, and $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m$ are the components of the vector $\va{v}$.
The basis vectors can be represented as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\vu{i} = \mqty[ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 ], \vu{j} = \mqty[ 0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 ], \ldots, \khat = \mqty[ 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 ]
\end{equation}
$$

## Common Linear Transformations

There are several common linear transformations that are frequently encountered in linear algebra.

### Scaling

A scaling transformation stretches or compresses vectors along a particular direction.

This is quite simple - you just multiply all the basis vectors by a scalar.

For example, consider the transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ defined by:

$$
\begin{equation}
T = \mqty[ 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 ]
\end{equation}
$$

$\vu{i}$ goes from $[1, 0]$ to $[2, 0]$, and $\vu{j}$ goes from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 3]$.
Hence, the transformation scales the space by a factor of 2 in the $x$-direction and 3 in the $y$-direction.

### Rotation

A rotation transformation rotates vectors in the vector space.

This is a bit more complex than scaling, but it can still be represented by a matrix.

Essentially, you rotate the basis vectors by a certain angle. To do so, we need to use some trigonometry.

Consider the transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ that rotates vectors by an angle $\theta$ counterclockwise.
It transforms $\vu{i}$ to $\vu{i}'$. To find $\vu{i}'$, we can observe it geometrically:

<Mafs
    viewBox={{
        x: [0, 1],
        y: [0,  0.5]
    }}
>
    {/* ihat */}
    <Vector
        tail={[0, 0]}
        tip={[1, 0]}
        color={color("blue")}
    />

    {/* ihat prime */}
    <Vector
        tail={[0, 0]}
        tip={[Math.cos(Math.PI / 5), Math.sin(Math.PI / 5)]}
        color={color("red")}
    />

    {/*
        Mafs uses KaTeX while the rest of the site uses MathJax.
        So the macros we defined in the site config won't work here.
    */}
    <LaTeX
        tex="\mathbf{\hat{i}}"
        at={lineLabel([0, 0], [1, 0], "right", { sideOffset: 0.1 })}
    />
    <LaTeX
        tex="\mathbf{\hat{i'}}"
        at={lineLabel([0, 0], [Math.cos(Math.PI / 5), Math.sin(Math.PI / 5)], "left", { sideOffset: 0.1 })}
    />

    <Angle
        at={[0, 0]}
        fromRad={0}
        toRad={Math.PI / 5}
        label="\theta"
        radius={0.2}
    />

## Proving the Properties of Linear Transformations

To prove that a function is a linear transformation, you need to show that it satisfies the two properties mentioned earlier: additivity and homogeneity.

Consider this matrix:

$$
\begin{equation}
A = \mqty[ \va{v_1} \va{v_2} \cdots \va{v_n} ]
\end{equation}
$$

Each vector $\va{v_i}$ is a column vector in the matrix $A$ and has $m$ components, so $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.

Let $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a function defined by $T(\va{x}) = A\va{x}$.

We can express $\va{x}$ as $[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]^T$ and, hence, $A\va{x}$ as:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(\va{x}) = \mqty[ \va{v_1} \va{v_2} \cdots \va{v_n} ] \mqty[ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n ] = x_1\va{v_1} + x_2\va{v_2} + \cdots + x_n\va{v_n}
\end{equation}
$$
