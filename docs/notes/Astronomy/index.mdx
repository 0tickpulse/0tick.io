# Astronomy

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole.
Astrophysics is a branch of astronomy that applies the principles of physics and chemistry to understand how stars, galaxies, and the universe evolve.

Virtually all of the concepts we have learned in relativity and quantum field theory can be applied to astrophysics.
Newtonian mechanics describes the motion of planets and other celestial objects.
Studies of particle physics and high-energy physics are essential for understanding phenomena such as cosmic rays, black holes, and the early universe.
Condensed matter physics is crucial for understanding the properties of matter in extreme environments, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs.
Nuclear physics tells us about the processes that power stars and the synthesis of elements in the universe.
Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are universally applicable, as they describe the behavior of matter and energy in various astrophysical systems.
Even chemistry is important for understanding the composition of stars and planets, as well as the formation of molecules in space.
Recently, for example, astrochemistry has become instrumental in the studies of abiogenesis.

For this section, we will follow Carroll and Ostlie's "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics" as a reference.
I will obviously include other sources as well, but this is a great general textbook that covers a wide range of topics in astrophysics.

Assumed knowledge includes classical (Newtonian, perhaps some Lagrangian and Hamiltonian) mechanics, electromagnetism, special and general relativity, as well as quantum mechanics.
These are all topics I have written notes on, which is why I do not plan to cover them in detail here.
Some knowledge of statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and nuclear physics is also helpful, but as these are not topics I have written notes on, I will try to include some background information as needed.
