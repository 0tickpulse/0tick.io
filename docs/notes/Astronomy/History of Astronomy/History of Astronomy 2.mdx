# History of Astronomy: Part 2

Previously, we discussed the history of astronomy, focusing on developments prior to Newtonian mechanics.
In this section, we will continue our exploration of the history of astronomy, focusing on developments from the time of Newton to the present day.

## Galileo and Newton

The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century revolutionized astronomy.
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was one of the first to use a telescope to observe the heavens.
He was the first to propose a version of Newton's first law, as well as the kinematic principles of acceleration.
Using his telescope, Galileo made several important discoveries, including:

- The Milky Way is actually composed of a vast number of individual stars, instead of being a nebulous cloud as previously thought.
- The four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) orbit the planet, providing strong evidence against the geocentric model of the universe.
- The phases of Venus, which could only be explained by a heliocentric model (as the sun's light illuminates different portions of Venus as it orbits the sun).
- The rough and uneven surface of the Moon, which contradicted the Aristotelian idea of perfect celestial spheres.
- Sunspots on the surface of the Sun, indicating that the Sun is not a perfect, unchanging body.

Galileo's observations provided strong evidence in favor of the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, and they challenged the prevailing Aristotelian view of the cosmos.
The Catholic Church, which held significant influence over intellectual life in Europe at the time, challenged Galileo's findings.
In 1616, The Holy Office declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical."
Galileo was also warned by Cardinal Roberto Bellarmine not to "hold, teach, or defend" the heliocentric view.

In 1623, however, his friend and admirer Cardinal Maffeo Barberini became Pope Urban VIII, and Galileo was given permission to write about heliocentrism as a hypothesis.
He published his findings in "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" in 1632, which presented arguments for both the geocentric and heliocentric models.
While it was technically neutral, the book was clearly biased in favor of heliocentrism.
The character representing the heliocentric view was named "Salviati," after Galileo's friend and supporter, while the character representing the geocentric view was named "Simplicio," which was interpreted as a derogatory term meaning "simpleton."
As a result, Galileo was tried by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633 and found "vehemently suspect of heresy."
He was forced to recant his views and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.

Despite the controversy surrounding Galileo's work, his observations laid the groundwork for future developments in astronomy and physics.
Eventually, in 1992, Pope John Paul II formally acknowledged the errors made by the Church in its handling of the Galileo affair.

Isaac Newton (1643–1727) built upon the work of Galileo and others to develop a comprehensive theory of motion and gravitation.
While the Plague ravaged Europe in 1665, Newton retreated to his family estate in Woolsthorpe, where he made several groundbreaking discoveries.
His Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), published in 1687, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.
In the Principia, Newton formulated his three laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation, as well as differential and integral calculus (independently developed by Leibniz).
He also published his work on optics in Optiks in 1704, where he described the nature of light and color.

Newton was one of the most intelligent and influential scientists in history.
When faced with the Brachistochrone problem, he solved it in a single night, inventing the calculus of variations in the process.
By Newton's request, his solution was published anonymously in the 1696 edition of the Journal des Sçavans.
Bernoulli, who had posed the problem, recognized Newton's solution and famously remarked, "I recognize the lion by his claw."

Newton's law of gravitation applies to planets (spheres) with spherical symmetry.
This can be proven by either integrating over the volume of the sphere or by using Gauss's law for gravity.
The latter provides a very elegant proof, but did not exist until the developments of Carl Friedrich Gauss in the 19th century.

We should be vehemently familiar with Newton's laws of motion and gravitation, as they form the basis of classical mechanics.
Nevertheless, it is worth briefly reviewing them here. We will do so by deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from Newton's law of gravitation.
We must first establish the necessary mathematical tools.

### Center-of-Mass Reference Frame

In a system of particles, the center of mass (COM) is the weighted average position of all the particles, where the weights are given by their masses.
For a system of $N$ particles with masses $m_i$ and positions $\vb{r}_i$, the position of the center of mass $\vb{R}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{R} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vb{r}_i,
\end{equation}
$$

where $M = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i$ is the total mass of the system.

If we rearrange and differentiate this equation, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M \dv{\vb{R}}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dv{\vb{r}_i}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \vb{v}_i = \vb{P},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{P}$ is the total momentum of the system.
Differentiating again, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv{\vb{P}}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \dv{\vb{v}_i}{t} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \dv{\vb{p}_i}{t}.
\end{equation}
$$

Anyways, suppose we have a binary system of two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, and positions $\vb{r}_1$ and $\vb{r}_2$.
Let their center of mass be the origin, i.e., $\vb{R} = 0$.
Let $\vb{r}$ be the relative position vector from particle 1 to particle 2, i.e., $\vb{r} = \vb{r}_2 - \vb{r}_1$.
Each particle can then be expressed in terms of the center of mass and the relative position vector as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{r}_1 &= -\frac{m_2}{M} \vb{r}, \\
\vb{r}_2 &= \frac{m_1}{M} \vb{r}.
\end{align}
$$

If we define the **reduced mass** $\mu$ as

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu := \frac{m_1 m_2}{M} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2},
\end{equation}
$$

then each particle's position is

$$
\begin{align}
\vb{r}_1 &= -\frac{\mu}{m_1} \vb{r}, \\
\vb{r}_2 &= \frac{\mu}{m_2} \vb{r}.
\end{align}
$$

There are a few useful identities that we can derive from this.
First, Newton's third law gives $m_1 \vb{a}_1 = -m_2 \vb{a}_2$, so if we define the relative acceleration $\vb{a} := \vb{a}_2 - \vb{a}_1$, then

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{a} := \vb{a}_2 - \vb{a}_1 = \qty(1 + \frac{m_2}{m_1}) \vb{a}_2 = \frac{M}{m_1 m_2} m_1 \vb{a}_1 = \frac{1}{\mu} \vb{F}_{12},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{F}_{12}$ is the force on particle 1 due to particle 2. This means

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu \vb{a} = \vb{F}_{12}.
\end{equation}
$$

This means that we can treat the two-body problem as a one-body problem with mass $\mu$ moving under the influence of the force $\vb{F}_{12}$.
Second, the total kinetic energy of the system is

$$
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} \mu v^2,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\vb{v} = \vb{v}_2 - \vb{v}_1$ is the relative velocity.
Third, the total angular momentum of the system about the center of mass is

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{L} = \vb{r}_1 \times m_1 \vb{v}_1 + \vb{r}_2 \times m_2 \vb{v}_2 = \mu \vb{r} \times \vb{v}.
\end{equation}
$$

The gravitational potential energy of the system is

$$
\begin{equation}
U = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r} = -\frac{G \mu M}{r}.
\end{equation}
$$

### Kepler's First Law

{/* Todo */}

### Virial Theorem

One important result that we will need is the virial theorem.
For a stable, bound system of particles interacting through a potential $U(\vb{r})$, the virial theorem states that

$$
\begin{equation}
\expval{E} = \frac{1}{2} \expval{U},
\end{equation}
$$

where $E$ is the total kinetic energy of the system, and the angle brackets denote a time average.
(Of course, this is only true for potentials that are homogeneous functions of degree $n = -1$, such as the gravitational potential.)
The angle brackets can be formally defined as a functional of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
\expval{\phi} := \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^\tau \phi(t) \dd{t},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\tau$ is the time period over which the average is taken.

## Light and Optics

Another field that Newton made significant contributions to was optics.
In his book Optiks, published in 1704, Newton described his experiments with light and color.
He demonstrated that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, which can be separated using a prism.
He also proposed the particle theory of light, suggesting that light is made up of tiny particles called "corpuscles."
This theory was later challenged by the wave theory of light, which was supported by experiments such as Thomas Young's double-slit experiment in 1801.

### Stellar Parallax and the Magnitude System

In their original forms, Kepler's laws of planetary motion were based on the relative sizes of the orbits, for their absolute sizes were not known.
In 1761, however, the first successful measurement of the distance to Venus was made during a transit of Venus across the Sun (This is credited to Jean‑Baptiste Chappe d’Auteroche.).
By observing the transit from different locations on Earth, astronomers were able to use parallax to calculate the distance to Venus and, consequently, the distance from Earth to the Sun (the astronomical unit, or AU).
In 1838, Friedrich Bessel made the first successful measurement of stellar parallax, determining the distance to the star 61 Cygni.
This parallax effect is extremely useful; our eyes use it to perceive depth, and astronomers use it to measure distances to nearby stars.

import { StellarParallaxVisualizer } from "./History of Astronomy Figures.mdx"

<StellarParallaxVisualizer />

If the distance from the Sun to a planet is $d$ then, and the lines (blue and yellow in the figure above) are perpendicular, the parallax angle $p$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\tan(p) = \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{d} \implies d = \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{\tan(p)} \approx \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{p} \quad (p \ll 1),
\end{equation}
$$

from simple trigonometry, where $p$ is the parallax angle.

As one radian is $57.2957795^\circ = 206264.806''$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
d \approx \frac{206264.806 \text{ AU}}{p''},
\end{equation}
$$

and we define the **parsec** (pc, parallax-second) as the numerator $206264.806$ AU, so that

$$
\begin{equation}
d \approx \frac{1 \text{ pc}}{p''}.
\end{equation}
$$

As the distances to stars are so vast, the parallax angles are extremely small.
This was why it took so long to notice the effect.
Modern instruments are being developed to measure parallax angles.
For instance, NASA's planned Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) aims to measure parallax angles with a precision of 1 microarcsecond, allowing for distance measurements to stars up to 10,000 light-years away.

Along with the parallax effect, scientists at the time also studied and utilized the other behaviors of light.
Galileo's telescope is one called a **refracting telescope**, which uses lenses to bend and focus light.
On the other hand, Newton built the first **reflecting telescope**, which uses mirrors to gather and focus light.
The refracting telescope makes use of Snell's law of refraction, named after Willebrord Snellius, who discovered it in 1621.
(Although, Snell's law was first discovered by Persian scientist Ibn Sahl in 984 AD.
The attribution of discoveries to Western scientists is a common theme in the history of science, often overlooking contributions from other cultures.)
This law states that each material had a quantity called the **index of refraction** $n_\lambda$, which describes how much the speed of light is reduced inside the material compared to vacuum.
The change in the speed of light causes the light to bend at the interface between two materials with different indices of refraction.
Then, the law follows that

$$
\begin{equation}
n_{1\lambda} \sin(\theta_1) = n_{2\lambda} \sin(\theta_2),
\end{equation}
$$

where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively, and the subscript $\lambda$ indicates that the index of refraction can depend on the wavelength of light.
One immediate use of Snell's law is in the design of lenses for telescopes and other optical instruments.
Each lens has a specific **focal length** $f_\lambda$, which is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.
It follows the **lensmaker's equation**

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{f_\lambda} = (n_\lambda - 1) \qty(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}),
\end{equation}
$$

where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens.
The study of optics from a geometric perspective, known as geometric optics, is fascinating, and we will dedicate a future note to it.

### Magnitude Scale

Other than distance, another important property of stars is their brightness.
Hipparchus, who we met earlier, developed the first known magnitude scale for classifying the brightness of stars.
It was quite primitive, using the naked eye to classify stars into six categories, with $m = 1$ being the brightest and $m = 6$ being the faintest visible to the naked eye.
This quantity $m$ is known as the **apparent magnitude** of a star.
Primitive it was, it was nevertheless used as the basis for more recent magnitude scales.

For instance, in 1856, Norman Pogson proposed a logarithmic scale for magnitudes, where a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a brightness ratio of 100.
In other words, a $m = 1$ star is 100 times brighter than a $m = 6$ star, and $100^{1/5} \approx 2.512$ times brighter than a $m = 2$ star.
This value $2.512$ is known as Pogson's ratio.
Additionally, the scale was extended to include negative magnitudes for very bright objects, such as the Sun ($m \approx -26.74$) and the full Moon ($m \approx -12.74$).

To further understand the magnitude scale, we need to understand how we measure brightness.
Suppose we have a detector with an effective area $A$ that is a distance $d$ away from a star emitting a total power (luminosity) $L$.
The **radiant flux** (or **irradiance**) $F$ is defined as the power received per unit area, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
F := \frac{L}{A}.
\end{equation}
$$

To get a more useful quantity, pretend that we have completely surrounded the star with a sphere of radius $d$.
It then emits a total power $L$ through the surface area of the sphere, which is $4 \pi d^2$.
The radiant flux at the surface of the sphere is then

$$
\begin{equation}
F := \frac{L}{4 \pi d^2}.
\end{equation}
$$

Notice that since the flux is a function of distance, it does not matter what the shape of the detector is or its area; the flux is the same everywhere on the sphere.
This function is known as the inverse-square law, and it applies to any point source of radiation in three-dimensional space.

Now we can define the *absolute* magnitude $M$ of a star as the apparent magnitude it would have if it were located at a standard distance of 10 parsecs (pc) from Earth.
Mathematically, we have from Pogson's scale that

$$
\begin{equation}
m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{F_1}{F_2}),
\end{equation}
$$

where $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the fluxes (brightnesses) of the two stars.
Equivalently,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{F_1}{F_2} = 100^{(m_2 - m_1)/5}.
\end{equation}
$$

There are two important cases to consider.
First, consider two stars of the same luminosity but at variable distances.
If we let $m_1 = m$ be the apparent magnitude of that star at distance $d$, and $m_2 = M$ be its absolute magnitude at distance $10$ pc, then we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{F}{F_{10}} = 100^{(M - m)/5},
\end{equation}
$$

where $F$ is the flux at distance $d$, and $F_{10}$ is the flux at distance $10$ pc.
This allows us to relate the apparent and absolute magnitudes of a star.
We have, from the inverse-square law, that

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{F}{F_{10}} = \frac{L/(4 \pi d^2)}{L/(4 \pi (10 \text{ pc})^2)} = \frac{(10 \text{ pc})^2}{d^2}.
\end{equation}
$$

Combining these two equations, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M - m = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{(10 \text{ pc})^2}{d^2}) = 5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{d}{10 \text{ pc}}). \label{eq:distance_modulus}
\end{equation}
$$

The quantity $m - M$ is known as the **distance modulus**, and it provides a way to estimate the distance to a star based on its apparent and absolute magnitudes.

The second case is when we have two stars at the same distance but with different luminosities.
If we let one of the stars be the Sun with absolute magnitude $M_\odot$ and luminosity $L_\odot$, and the other be a star with absolute magnitude $M$ and luminosity $L$, then we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M - M_\odot = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{L}{L_\odot}).
\end{equation}
$$

We can express the luminosities in terms of their radiant fluxes at a standard distance of 10 pc.
Using the first half of Equation $\eqref{eq:distance_modulus}$, and noting $d^2 = L_\odot/(4 \pi F)$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M - M_\odot = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{(10 \text{ pc})^2}{L_\odot/(4 \pi F)}).
\end{equation}
$$

Similarly, we have $(10 \text{pc})^2 = L_\odot/(4 \pi F_{10,\odot})$, so we have

$$
\begin{equation}
M - M_\odot = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{L_\odot/(4 \pi F_{10,\odot})}{L_\odot/(4 \pi F)}) = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{F}{F_{10,\odot}}).
\end{equation}
$$

### Light and Wave Phenomena

Newton, as he stated in Optiks, believed that light was made up of tiny particles called "corpuscles."
One justification he gave was that shadows had sharp edges, which would be difficult to explain if light were a wave.
This theory was later challenged by the wave theory of light, which was supported by experiments such as Thomas Young's double-slit experiment in 1801.
We now know that light is an excitation of a quantized electromagnetic field, and it exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties.
The wave-like properties come from oscillatory terms in field operators, while the particle-like properties originate from creation and annihilation operators.
Anyways, we will briefly review how humans came to understand the wave nature of light.

Initially, light was thought to travel instantaneously, as no delay could be detected by the naked eye.
In 1676, Ole Rømer made the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light by observing the eclipses of Jupiter's moons.
He noticed that the observed times of the eclipses varied depending on the distance between Earth and Jupiter.
By analyzing these variations, he estimated the speed of light to be approximately $2.26 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$, which is about 25% lower than the actual value.

In modern times, the speed of light in a vacuum is a defining constant in the International System of Units (SI).
It is exactly $299,792,458 \text{ m/s}$, and it is denoted by the symbol $c$.
The meter is now derived using the speed of light, defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in $1/299,792,458$ of a second.

Advancing further, Christian Huygens (1629–1695) proposed the wave theory of light in the late 17th century.
He suggested that light propagates as a wave, similar to sound or water waves.
As such, they had the same mathematical description with quantites like wavelength $\lambda$, frequency $\nu$, and speed $c$ related by the equation

$$
\begin{equation}
c = \lambda \nu.
\end{equation}
$$

Huygens' principle states that every point on a wavefront can be considered a source of secondary wavelets, which spread out in all directions at the same speed as the wave itself.
The new wavefront is then the envelope of these secondary wavelets.

One demonstration of the wave nature of light came from Thomas Young's double-slit experiment in 1801.
In this experiment, light from a single source passes through two pinholes (nowadays we use slits) and creates an interference pattern on a screen behind the slits.
The pattern consists of alternating bright and dark fringes, which can be explained by the constructive and destructive interference of the light waves emanating from the two slits.

If the distance between the slits is $d$, the distance from the slits to the screen is $L$, then at an angle $\theta$ from the central axis, the path difference between the two waves is $d \sin(\theta)$.
Constructive interference (bright fringes) occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda, \quad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots
\end{equation}
$$

whereas destructive interference (dark fringes) occurs when the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
d \sin(\theta) = \qty(m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda, \quad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots.
\end{equation}
$$

This can also be extended to multiple slits, which is the basis for diffraction gratings used in spectroscopy.
In a diffraction grating with $N$ slits, the condition for constructive interference becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda, \quad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots,
\end{equation}
$$

where $d$ is now the distance between adjacent slits.

### Electrodynamics and the EM Spectrum

Prior to the 19th century, there were three interesting phenomena known to physicists: electricity, magnetism, and light.
It was not until the work of James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) that these phenomena were unified into a single theory known as electromagnetism.
Maxwell's equations, published in the 1860s, describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and propagate through space.

As we have seen multiple times, Maxwell's equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate at the speed of light.
Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) experimentally confirmed the existence of these waves in the late 1880s.
He produced and detected radio waves in the laboratory, demonstrating that they exhibited the same properties as light, such as reflection, refraction, and polarization.
Unfortunately, this work was only done ten years after Maxwell's death, so he did not live to see his predictions confirmed.

John Henry Poynting (1852–1914) further developed the theory of electromagnetism by describing the energy flow in electromagnetic fields.
He introduced the Poynting vector $\vb{S}$, which represents the directional energy

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \vb{E} \times \vb{B},
\end{equation}
$$

equal to the energy per unit area per unit time (power per unit area) carried by an electromagnetic wave.
Its time average $\expval{\vb{S}}$ gives the average power flow, which in a vacuum is

$$
\begin{equation}
\expval{\vb{S}} = \frac{1}{2\mu_0} E_0 B_0 \hat{\vb{k}},
\end{equation}
$$

where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, and $\hat{\vb{k}}$ is the unit vector in the direction of wave propagation.
Knowing that energy exists in electromagnetic waves, it is natural to deduce that light can cause physical effects.
Suppose light is completely absorbed by a surface. The equivalent force due to radiation pressure is

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{F} = \frac{\expval{\vb{S}} A}{c} \cdot \hat{\vb{k}}.
\end{equation}
$$

where $A$ is the area of the surface.
If the light is completely reflected, the force is doubled, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation}
\vb{F} = \frac{2 \expval{\vb{S}} A}{c} \cdot \hat{\vb{k}}.
\end{equation}
$$

This effect is extremely small for everyday light intensities, but it can be significant in astrophysical contexts, such as the pressure exerted by sunlight on comet tails or the concept of solar sails for spacecraft propulsion.
When we study early main-sequence stars, accelerating particles, and other high-energy astrophysical phenomena, we will see that radiation pressure can be a dominant force.

## Radiation and the Birth of Quantum Mechanics

As previously discussed, Maxwell's equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate at the speed of light.
These waves can have a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, forming the electromagnetic spectrum.

When an object is heated, the average kinetic energy of its atoms and molecules increases, causing them to vibrate more vigorously.
The vibration of charged particles (such as electrons) produces electromagnetic radiation.
The spectrum of this radiation depends on the temperature of the object.
This phenomenon was first discovered by Thomas Wedgewood (1771–1805) in the late 18th century, who observed that heated objects emit light.

A perfect blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all incident radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.
When a blackbody is heated, it emits radiation with a characteristic spectrum that depends only on its temperature.
To mathematically describe this phenomenon, German physicist Wilheim Wien (1864–1928) proposed Wien's displacement law in 1893, which states that the wavelength $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ at which the emission of a blackbody spectrum is maximized is inversely proportional to its temperature $T$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} T = b = 2.897771955 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m K},
\end{equation}
$$

where $b$ is a proportionality factor known as Wien's displacement constant.
Another law that was important was the Stefan-Boltzmann law, named as such because it was first derived empirically by Josef Stefan (1835–1893) in 1879 and later derived theoretically by Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) in 1884.
It states

$$
\begin{equation}
L = A \sigma T^4,
\end{equation}
$$

where $L$ is the total power radiated by a blackbody, $A$ is its surface area, $T$ is its absolute temperature, and $\sigma = 5.670374419 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W m}^{-2} \text{ K}^{-4}$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
In astrophysics, stars are not perfect blackbodies, so we actually use the law to *define* an **effective temperature** $T_{\text{eff}}$ of a star, which is the temperature a perfect blackbody would need to have to emit the same total power per unit area as the star.

By the end of the 19th century, physicists and astronomers at the time believed that they had a complete understanding of the laws of physics.
Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electromagnetism were well-established theories that explained what seemed to be all physical phenomena.
It is worth noting how remarkably successful these theories were despite what we now know to be their limitations.
This Newtonian paradigm was built upon centuries of scientific progress, some of which we have discussed in this section.
We have seen the works of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Ptolemy, the revolutionary ideas of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler during the Renaissance, and the groundbreaking contributions of Newton, Maxwell et al. in the 17th century.
By the late 19th century, the scientific community believed that they had a complete understanding of the laws of physics, and many physicists thought that only minor details remained to be discovered.

However, several experimental results in the late 19th and early 20th centuries challenged this Newtonian paradigm and led to the development of new theories.
One of the most significant challenges came from the study of blackbody radiation.
Physicists realized that there was no theoretical basis for the exact shape of the blackbody spectrum.
Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) attempted to derive the spectrum using electromagnetic theory and classical statistical mechanics.
Specifically, he considered a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls, which contains standing electromagnetic waves.
Let $L$ be the length of each side of the cavity.

As they are standing waves, the permitted wavelengths are $\lambda = 2L, L, 2L/3, L/2, \ldots$, or more generally $\lambda = 2L/n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$.
Each wavelength would receive energy equal to $k_B T$ from the equipartition theorem, where $k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J K}^{-1}$ is Boltzmann's constant.
This eventually led to the Rayleigh-Jeans law

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda (T) = \frac{2 c k_B T}{\lambda^4},
\end{equation}
$$

where $B_\lambda(T)$ is the spectral radiance of the blackbody at temperature $T$.
This law agreed with experimental results at long wavelengths (low frequencies) but diverged significantly at short wavelengths (high frequencies), leading to what was known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe."
Another law that was proposed was Wien's law, which was an empirical fit to the blackbody spectrum at short wavelengths.
It is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda (T) = a \lambda^{-5} e^{-b/(\lambda T)},
\end{equation}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants determined experimentally.
Wien's law agreed with experimental results at short wavelengths but failed at long wavelengths.

The resolution to this problem came from Max Planck (1858–1947) in 1900.
Planck proposed that Wien's law could be slightly modified to fit the entire blackbody spectrum:

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda (T) = \frac{a/\lambda^5}{e^{b/(\lambda T)} - 1}.
\end{equation}
$$

This is the important part.
To identify the constants $a$ and $b$, Planck made a bold assumption: he proposed that a wave could only have specific energies that were integer multiples of a minimum energy (a **quantum** of energy) given by

$$
\begin{equation}
E = h \nu = \frac{h c}{\lambda},
\end{equation}
$$

where $h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}$ is now known as Planck's constant.
While he initially sought to set $h = 0$ to recover classical physics, he found that this was not possible if he wanted to fit the experimental data.
Eventually, he derived **Planck's law** for blackbody radiation:

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda (T) = \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1}.
\end{equation}
$$

Equivalently, as a function of frequency, it is

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\nu (T) = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/(k_B T)} - 1}.
\end{equation}
$$

This law agreed perfectly with experimental results across all wavelengths and temperatures.

Let's explore how this can be used for a star of radius $R$ and temperature $T$.
The quantity $B_\lambda(T)$ is the spectral radiance, which is the power emitted per unit area per unit solid angle per unit wavelength.
A solid angle $\dd{\Omega}$ is defined in spherical coordinates as

$$
\begin{equation}
\dd{\Omega} = \sin(\theta) \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi},
\end{equation}
$$

where $\theta$ is the polar angle (measured from the $z$-axis) and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (measured in the $xy$-plane from the $x$-axis).
As $B_\lambda(T)$ is per wavelength, area, and solid angle, the infinitesimal power emitted per unit area in a wavelength interval $\dd{\lambda}$, area $\dd{A}$, and solid angle $\dd{\Omega}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} \dd{A} \cos(\theta) \dd{\Omega} = B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} \dd{A} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi}.
\end{equation}
$$

The $\cos(\theta)$ term arises because the effective area "seen" by the radiation is reduced by a factor of $\cos(\theta)$ when the radiation is emitted at an angle $\theta$ from the normal to the surface.
Now, to get the total power emitted per unit area over all directions for a wavelength interval $\dd{\lambda}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} &= \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_{\text{(Area)}} B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} \dd{A} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi} \\
&= B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} \int_{\text{(Area)}} \dd{A} \int_0^{2\pi} \dd{\phi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \dd{\theta} \\
&= B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} 4\pi R^2 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{2} \\
&= 4 \pi^2 R^2 B_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Plugging in Planck's law, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} &= 4 \pi^2 R^2 \frac{2 h c^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1} \dd{\lambda} \\
&= \frac{8 \pi^2 h c^2 R^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1} \dd{\lambda},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

known as the **monochromatic luminosity** of the star, for the wavelength is in an infinitesimal interval so the color does not change.
The flux for monochromatic luminosity is known as the **monochromatic flux**, given via the inverse-square law as

$$
\begin{equation}
F_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} = \frac{L_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda}}{4 \pi d^2} = \frac{2 \pi h c^2 R^2}{d^2 \lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1} \dd{\lambda}, \label{eq:monochromatic_flux}
\end{equation}
$$

where $d$ is the distance from the star to the observer.
Anyways, integrating Planck's law over all wavelengths, we have the total luminosity of the star:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
L(T) &= \int_0^\infty L_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda} = 8 \pi^2 h c^2 R^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1} \dd{\lambda} \\
&= 8 \pi^2 h c^2 R^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{(hc/(k_B T))^4} \frac{1}{e^x - 1} \dd{x} \quad (x = \frac{hc}{\lambda k_B T}, \dd{\lambda} = -\frac{hc}{k_B T x^2} \dd{x}) \\
&= 8 \pi^2 h c^2 R^2 \frac{(k_B T)^4}{(hc)^4} \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \dd{x} \\
&= 8 \pi^2 h c^2 R^2 \frac{(k_B T)^4}{(hc)^4} \cdot \frac{\pi^4}{15} \\
&= 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

recovering the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where we have used the fact that $\int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \dd{x} = \frac{\pi^4}{15}$.
We can prove this integral with complex analysis, as we have done before, but we will not do so here.
Anyways, we can see that the $\sigma$ constant is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{2 \pi^5 k_B^4}{15 c^2 h^3}.
\end{equation}
$$

This derivation shows how Planck's law leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law and provides a theoretical basis for the effective temperature of stars.

### Color and Spectral Classification

With the understanding of blackbody radiation and Planck's law, astronomers could now relate the color of a star to its temperature.
An important question was how to classify, measure, and compare the light from different stars.

The magnitude can be classified using the magnitude system we discussed earlier.
However, this system does not account for the color of the star.
One idea is to use filters to isolate specific wavelength ranges and measure the brightness in those ranges.
For example, the UBV photometric system uses three filters: U (ultraviolet), B (blue), and V (visual).
The Johnson-Cousins UBVRI system extends this to include R (red) and I (infrared) filters.

We can measure each star's apparent magnitudes physically by observing them through these filters.
A filter is essentially a piece of glass or plastic that only allows light of certain wavelengths to pass through.
Historically, astronomers used photographic plates with different emulsions to create filters that were sensitive to specific wavelength ranges.
Nowadays, we use more advanced materials and technologies to create filters with precise transmission properties.

The difference in magnitudes between two filters is known as a **color index**.
For instance, the color index $B - V$ is defined as the difference between the apparent magnitudes measured through the B and V filters:

$$
\begin{equation}
B - V = m_B - m_V.
\end{equation}
$$

When we measure the apparent and absolute magnitudes over all wavelengths, the result is known as the **bolometric magnitude**.
However, since we cannot observe all wavelengths (for instance, ultraviolet and infrared light are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere), we often use the **visual magnitude** $m_V$ and **absolute visual magnitude** $M_V$, which are measured using the V filter.
To account for the difference between the bolometric and visual magnitudes, we introduce the **bolometric correction** $BC$, defined as

$$
\begin{equation}
BC := M_{\text{bol}} - M_V.
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we want to relate the apparent magnitudes measured through different filters to the other physical properties of stars.
A star's ultraviolet (U) magnitude, for instance, can be written as

$$
\begin{equation}
m_U = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\int_0^\infty F_\lambda (T) \mathcal{S}_U(\lambda) \dd{\lambda}) + C_U,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathcal{S}_U(\lambda)$ is a sensitivity function that describes how the U filter responds to different wavelengths, and $C_U$ is a constant that depends on the calibration of the photometric system.
Such a constant also exists when we measure the bolometric magnitude.
A bolometer (a device that measures the total power of incident electromagnetic radiation), in ideal conditions, would measure the total flux from a star without any wavelength dependence.
Thus we have $\mathcal{S}_{\text{bol}}(\lambda) = 1$ for all $\lambda$, and the bolometric magnitude is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
m_{\text{bol}} = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\int_0^\infty F_\lambda (T) \dd{\lambda}) + C_{\text{bol}}.
\end{equation}
$$

The value for $C_{\text{bol}}$ is arbitrary, much like how potential energy is defined up to an additive constant.
Historically, as the bolometric correction is given by $BC = M_{\text{bol}} - M_V$, astronomers have chosen to set $C_{\text{bol}}$ such that $BC$ is negative for all stars while remaining as small as possible.
This should make sense; there is a small amount of ultraviolet and infrared light that is not captured by the V filter, and the sign is negative because magnitudes are defined such that brighter objects have lower (more negative) magnitudes.

The color index $U - B$ can be calculated as

$$
\begin{equation}
U - B = m_U - m_B = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{\int_0^\infty F_\lambda (T) \mathcal{S}_U(\lambda) \dd{\lambda}}{\int_0^\infty F_\lambda (T) \mathcal{S}_B(\lambda) \dd{\lambda}}) + (C_U - C_B).
\end{equation}
$$

If we plug in the monochromatic flux from Equation $\eqref{eq:monochromatic_flux}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
U - B = -2.5 \log_{10} \qty(\frac{\int_0^\infty \frac{\mathcal{S}_U(\lambda)}{\lambda^5 (e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1)} \dd{\lambda}}{\int_0^\infty \frac{\mathcal{S}_B(\lambda)}{\lambda^5 (e^{hc/(\lambda k_B T)} - 1)} \dd{\lambda}}) + (C_U - C_B).
\end{equation}
$$

In other words, the distance $d$ and radius $R$ of the star cancel out, and the color index only depends on the temperature $T$ of the star and the properties of the filters used.

Astronomers can use this relationship to estimate the temperature of a star based on its color index.
If we plot the color index $U - B$ against the color index $B - V$ for a large number of stars, we obtain a diagram known as the **color-color diagram**.
This diagram reveals a clear correlation between the two color indices, which can be used to classify stars based on their temperatures.

## Summary and Next Steps
