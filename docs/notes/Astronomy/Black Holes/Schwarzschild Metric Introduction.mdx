# Schwarzschild Metric: Introduction

As previously mentioned, Einstein's general relativity is our current best theory of gravity.
In his theory, gravity is not a force but rather a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of energy-momentum.
The Einstein field equations relate the geometry of spacetime, described by the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, to the energy-momentum content, described by the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$.

Few exact solutions to the Einstein field equations are known, as they are a set of ten coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations.
One such solution is the Schwarzschild metric, which is given in spherical coordinates $(ct, r, \theta, \phi)$ by

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} \overset{.}{=} \mqty[
    \qty(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -\qty(1 - \frac{r_s}{r})^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
].
\end{equation}
$$

This metric describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, and static mass.
As such, it can be applied to various astrophysical objects, such as (slowly rotating) stars, planets, and black holes.
When applied to the field equations, it makes many predictions, such as gravitational time dilation, the gravitational Doppler effect, the bending of light by gravity, and the precession of planetary orbits.
Moreover, it predicts the existence of black holes whose event horizons are located at the Schwarzschild radius

$$
\begin{equation}
r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}.
\end{equation}
$$

## Derivation of the Schwarzschild Metric

Karl Schwarzschild derived this metric in 1916, shortly after Einstein published his field equations in 1915.
His results were published in two papers: ["On the Gravitational Field of a Point-Mass according to Einstein's Theory"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9905030) and ["On the Gravitational Field of a Sphere of Incompressible Fluid according to Einstein's Theory."](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9912033)
Unfortunately, Schwarzschild passed away in 1916 due to complications from a disease he contracted during his service in World War I.

The derivation of the Schwarzschild metric involves several steps, including making assumptions about the symmetry of the spacetime, choosing an appropriate coordinate system, and solving the Einstein field equations under these assumptions.

The first assumption is that outside the mass, the spacetime is vacuum, meaning that the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$.
It leads to the **Ricci flat condition**, as described in the following infobox.

:::info Ricci Flat Condition

Assuming $\Lambda = 0$ (in non-cosmological scales) and $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$, the Einstein field equations reduce to

$$
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Taking the trace of this equation by contracting both sides with $g^{\mu\nu}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Since $g_{\mu\nu} g^{\mu\nu} = \delta_\mu^\mu = 4$ in four-dimensional spacetime, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
R - 2R = 0 \implies R = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Finally, substituting $R = 0$ back into the original equation yields

$$
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Note that a Ricci flat spacetime does not imply a flat spacetime, as the Riemann curvature tensor $R^\rho_{\sigma\mu\nu}$ may still be non-zero.
Recall that the Ricci tensor describes the degree to which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a curved space deviates from that in flat space, while the Riemann curvature tensor provides a more comprehensive description of the curvature of spacetime, including things like holonomy and tidal forces.

:::

The second assumption is that the spacetime is spherically symmetric and static.
This means that the $theta$ and $\phi$ components of the metric must be the same as those in flat spacetime, as there is no preferred direction in a spherically symmetric spacetime.
The third is that the metric should reduce to the Minkowski metric at large distances from the mass, where gravitational effects are negligible.
In other words,

$$
\begin{equation}
\lim_{r \to \infty} g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
$$

The Minkowski metric in spherical coordinates is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\eta_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
].
\end{equation}
$$

<details>
<summary>Derivation</summary>

Let's derive the Minkowski metric in spherical coordinates.
In Cartesian coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$, the Minkowski metric is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\eta_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -1
].
\end{equation}
$$

To convert to spherical coordinates $(t, r, \theta, \phi)$, we use the following transformations:

$$
\begin{align}
t &= t, \\
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}, \\
\theta &= \arccos\left(\frac{z}{r}\right), \\
\phi &= \arctan2(y, x).
\end{align}
$$

The basis vectors (which are just the partial derivative operators) can be expanded using the chain rule:

$$
\begin{align}
\pdv{t} &= \pdv{t}, \\
\pdv{r} &= \pdv{x}{r} \pdv{x} + \pdv{y}{r} \pdv{y} + \pdv{z}{r} \pdv{z} \\
\pdv{\theta} &= \pdv{x}{\theta} \pdv{x} + \pdv{y}{\theta} \pdv{y} + \pdv{z}{\theta} \pdv{z} \\
\pdv{\phi} &= \pdv{x}{\phi} \pdv{x} + \pdv{y}{\phi} \pdv{y} + \pdv{z}{\phi} \pdv{z}
\end{align}
$$

Calculating the partial derivatives, we have

$$
\begin{align}
\pdv{r} &= \sin\theta \cos\phi \pdv{x} + \sin\theta \sin\phi \pdv{y} + \cos\theta \pdv{z}, \\
\pdv{\theta} &= r \cos\theta \cos\phi \pdv{x} + r \cos\theta \sin\phi \pdv{y} - r \sin\theta \pdv{z}, \\
\pdv{\phi} &= -r \sin\theta \sin\phi \pdv{x} + r \sin\theta \cos\phi \pdv{y} + 0 \pdv{z},
\end{align}
$$

so the metric is

$$
\begin{align}
g_{rr} &= \qty(\pdv{r}) \cdot \qty(\pdv{r}) = -1, \\
g_{\theta\theta} &= \qty(\pdv{\theta}) \cdot \qty(\pdv{\theta}) = -r^2, \\
g_{\phi\phi} &= \qty(\pdv{\phi}) \cdot \qty(\pdv{\phi}) = -r^2 \sin^2 \theta, \\
g_{r\theta} &= g_{r\phi} = g_{\theta\phi} = 0,
\end{align}
$$

as you can verify by explicitly calculating the dot products.
Notice that the $g_{\theta\theta}$ and $g_{\phi\phi}$ components have factors of $r^2$.
This is because we are not using a normalized coordinate system.

</details>

The last assumption is that the metric should be static, meaning that it does not change with time.
The consequence is that

1. $\partial_t g_{\mu\nu} = 0$ (time independence), and
2. $g_{\mu\nu}(t) = g_{\mu\nu}(-t)$ (time reversal symmetry).

A more rigorous definition of a static spacetime is that it possesses a timelike Killing vector field that is hypersurface orthogonal.
With the last assumption, the $ti$ components of the metric must be zero, as they would change sign under time reversal.

To summarize, our assumptions are

1. Vacuum: $T_{\mu\nu} = 0 \implies R_{\mu\nu} = 0$,
2. Spherical symmetry,
3. Asymptotic flatness: $\lim_{r \to \infty} g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$,
4. Static: $\partial_t g_{\mu\nu} = 0$ and $g_{\mu\nu}(t) = g_{\mu\nu}(-t)$.

With these assumptions, we can write the metric as

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    g_{tt}(r, \theta, \phi) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & g_{rr}(r, \theta, \phi) & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -C(r) r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -C(r) r^2 \sin^2 \theta
].
\end{equation}
$$

The $g_{r\theta}$ and $g_{r\phi}$ components are zero as $r$ must point radially outward, while $\theta$ and $\phi$ point tangentially.
Moreover, the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components depend only on $r$ due to spherical symmetry and time independence.
As such, we can introduce the functions $A(r)$ and $B(r)$ such that

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    A(r) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -B(r) & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -C(r) r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -C(r) r^2 \sin^2 \theta
].
\end{equation}
$$

Lastly, we will make a coordinate shift of $r \to \sqrt{C(r)} r$ to eliminate the $C(r)$ function.
This leads us to

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    A(r) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -B(r) & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
],
\end{equation}
$$

with

$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{r \to \infty} A(r) &= 1, \\
\lim_{r \to \infty} B(r) &= 1.
\end{align}
$$

## LCC Coefficients

Our next step is to solve for the functions $A(r)$ and $B(r)$ by applying the Ricci flat condition $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$.
To do so, we need to choose a connection (a way to differentiate tensors on a manifold).
In general relativity, we use the Levi-Civita connection (LCC), which is the unique torsion-free connection that is compatible with the metric.
A LCC always exists for any (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold as stated by the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry.

The LCC coefficients (also known as Christoffel symbols) are given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\rho\sigma} \qty(\partial_\mu g_{\nu\sigma} + \partial_\nu g_{\mu\sigma} - \partial_\sigma g_{\mu\nu}).
\end{equation}
$$

I will not show the full derivation here, as it is quite tedious and can be found in many textbooks and online resources.
The non-zero LCC coefficients are

$$
\begin{align}
\Gamma_{00}^1 &= \frac{1}{2B} \partial_r A, \\
\Gamma_{01}^0 &= \Gamma_{10}^0 = \frac{1}{2A} \partial_r A, \\
\Gamma_{11}^1 &= \frac{1}{2B} \partial_r B, \\
\Gamma_{12}^2 &= \Gamma_{21}^2 = \frac{1}{r}, \\
\Gamma_{13}^3 &= \Gamma_{31}^3 = \frac{1}{r}, \\
\Gamma_{22}^1 &= -\frac{r}{B}, \\
\Gamma_{33}^1 &= -\frac{r \sin^2 \theta}{B}, \\
\Gamma_{23}^3 &= \Gamma_{32}^3 = \cot \theta.
\end{align}
$$

## Ricci Tensor

Next we can compute the Ricci tensor using the LCC coefficients.
Recall that Einstein's field equations tell us that $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$ in vacuum.
As such, we can compute the Ricci tensor and set it to zero to solve for $A(r)$ and $B(r)$.

Once again I will skip the full derivation. We only need to look at a few components of the Ricci tensor, as shown below.
Differentiation is with respect to $r$ unless otherwise specified.

$$
\begin{align}
R_{00} &= 2rABA'' - rAA'B' + 4ABA' - rB(A')^2 = 0, \\
R_{11} &= -2rABA'' + rB(A')^2 + rAA'B' + 4A^2B' &= 0, \\
R_{22} &= -2AB + 2AB^2 - rA'B + rAB' = 0
\end{align}
$$

We can add the first two equations to eliminate the second derivative term, yielding

$$
\begin{equation}
rA'B + rAB' = 0 \implies \partial_r (AB) = 0 \implies AB = \text{constant} = k_1.
\end{equation}
$$

As $r \to \infty$, we have $A \to 1$ and $B \to 1$, so $k_1 = 1$.

Plugging in these findings into the third equation, and doing some algebraic manipulation, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
A(r) = 1 - \frac{k_2}{r},
\end{equation}
$$

and naturally

$$
\begin{equation}
B(r) = \qty(1 - \frac{k_2}{r})^{-1}.
\end{equation}
$$

The constant $k_2$ turns out to be the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$, which can be determined by comparing the weak-field limit of the Schwarzschild metric to the Newtonian gravitational potential.

## Low-Field Limit

To determine the constant $k_2$, we can compare the Schwarzschild metric to the Newtonian gravitational potential in the weak-field limit.
In this limit, Poisson's equation holds and can be written as

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[2]{x^i}{t} + \pdv{\Phi}{x^i} = 0,
\end{equation}
$$

where $\Phi$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential.
Notice that this equation is similar to the geodesic equation in general relativity, which is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[2]{x^\mu}{\tau} + \Gamma^\mu_{\rho\sigma} U^\rho U^\sigma = 0,
\end{equation}
$$

if we set $\tau = t$, $U^0 = c$, and $U^i = 0$.
The geodesic equation reduces to

$$
\begin{equation}
\dv[2]{x^i}{t} + c^2 \Gamma^i_{00} = 0.
\end{equation}
$$

Comparing the two equations, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^i_{00} = \frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{\Phi}{x^i}.
\end{equation}
$$

Next, we also need to take the weak field limit of the metric to calculate this LCC coefficient.
In this limit, we can write the metric as a perturbation of the Minkowski metric:

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
$$

There are two assumptions we need to make here:

1. The perturbation is small: $|h_{\mu\nu}| \ll 1$. This means that the product $h_{\mu\nu} h_{\rho\sigma}$ is negligible.
2. The perturbation's derivatives are small: $|\partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu}| \ll 1$.
    This means that $(\partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu}) h_{\alpha\beta}$ and $(\partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu})(\partial_\rho h_{\alpha\beta})$ are negligible.

When we differentiate the metric, the Minkowski metric is constant, so we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_\sigma g_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
$$

As such, the LCC coefficient $\Gamma^i_{00}$ becomes

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma^i_{00} &= \frac{1}{2} g^{i\sigma} \qty(\partial_0 g_{0\sigma} + \partial_0 g_{0\sigma} - \partial_\sigma g_{00}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \eta^{i\sigma} \qty(\partial_0 h_{0\sigma} + \partial_0 h_{0\sigma} - \partial_\sigma h_{00}) \\
&= -\frac{1}{2} \eta^{ii} \qty(\partial_0 h_{0i} + \partial_0 h_{0i} - \partial_i h_{00}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (-1) (-\partial_i h_{00}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \partial_i h_{00}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

And since this must equal $\frac{1}{c^2} \pdv{\Phi}{x^i}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
\partial_i h_{00} = \frac{2}{c^2} \pdv{\Phi}{x^i} \implies h_{00} = \frac{2\Phi}{c^2} (+ \text{constant}).
\end{equation}
$$

We set the constant to zero, as we want the perturbation to vanish when the potential is zero.
For a spherically symmetric mass distribution, the Newtonian gravitational potential is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\Phi = -\frac{GM}{r}.
\end{equation}
$$

As such, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
h_{00} = -\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}.
\end{equation}
$$

This is true in both Cartesian and spherical coordinates, as the time component is invariant under spatial coordinate transformations.
Anyways, we can then compare this to the $g_{00}$ component of the Schwarzschild metric in the weak-field limit:

$$
\begin{equation}
1 - \frac{k_2}{r} = g_{00} = \eta_{00} + h_{00} = 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 r}.
\end{equation}
$$

This implies that $k_2 = \frac{2GM}{c^2} = r_s$.

Thus, we have derived the Schwarzschild metric:

$$
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu} = \mqty[
    \qty(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & -\qty(1 - \frac{r_s}{r})^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & -r^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
].
\end{equation}
$$

## Summary and Next Steps

In this note, we derived the Schwarzschild metric by making several assumptions about the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, and static mass.
We started with the Einstein field equations and applied the Ricci flat condition, spherical symmetry, asymptotic flatness, and staticity to simplify the metric.
Lastly, we determined the constants in the metric by comparing it to the Newtonian gravitational potential in the weak-field limit.

Next, we will explore how the Schwarzschild metric predicts various phenomena, such as gravitational time dilation, the gravitational Doppler effect, the bending of light by gravity, and the precession of planetary orbits.
