# Physics Wordle

This is a game similar to the popular game Wordle, but with physics equations.

:::note Credits

Much of this game is copied from [Thypher](https://thypher.com/) down to the code.
I just wanted to have a version that can be played infinitely instead of just once a day.
**Please play the original game!**

The word list comes from [here](https://wordiplypro.com/wordle-words-all-2309-words-from-the-wordle-dictionary/).
The equations are original, though they come from various sources, like the original Thypher, and many textbooks.
