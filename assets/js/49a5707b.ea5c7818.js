perspective."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Social science is fundamentally different from natural science.\nIn natural science, we can conduct controlled experiments to test hypotheses and theories.\nThese are often repeatable and yield consistent results from isolating variables.\nHowever, as we have seen in biology, human behavior is immensely complex, and it is impossible to attribute a molecular basis to every behavior.\nAs such, we rely on the emergent properties of neurological systems to understand human behavior.\nIdeas in psychology precisely are such emergent properties, and they are almost impossible to reduce to a molecular basis."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"In social science, we cannot conduct controlled experiments in the same way as in natural science.\nWe cannot isolate variables in a social context, as human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors, including cultural, social, economic, and political factors.\nMoreover, there is a significant amount of variability in human behavior, and experimenting on humans often raises ethical concerns.\nTherefore, social science tends to rely more on observational studies, surveys, and statistical analysis to understand human behavior and society.\nThe predictions that we make in social science do not have the same level of certainty as those in natural science, and they are often subject to change based on new data and insights."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This also means that social science tends to be more controversial and subject to debate.\nIn economics, there are many different schools of thought, each with its own theories and models.\nKeynesian economics is based on the ability of governmental intervention to stabilize the economy.\nClassical economics, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of free markets and limited government intervention.\nBehavioral economics incorporates insights from psychology to understand how individuals make decisions.\nSimilarly, in business management, there are various approaches and strategies for managing organizations, such as scientific management, human relations management, and contingency management.\nThese different approaches often lead to debates and disagreements among scholars and practitioners."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The pedagogical result of this is that we need to pick a specific framework to begin the study.\nThis is not to say that other frameworks are invalid, but rather that we need a starting point to build our understanding.\nWe begin with a specific framework, then analyze its limitations and shortcomings, and then explore alternative frameworks.\nNote that natural science also operates this way; in quantum mechanics, we almost always use the Copenhagen interpretation, and it is only after a thorough understanding of the theory that we explore alternative interpretations, such as the many-worlds interpretation or pilot-wave theory.\nWe discuss the ontological basis of Feynman's path integral only after studying how it works in practice.\nIn chemistry, we begin with the valence bond theory, and only after understanding its limitations (e.g. aromaticity, resonance, paramagnetism of O2) do we explore molecular orbital theory.\nTherefore this approach should not be unfamiliar."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Economics is unique in that it is a social science that is heavily quantitative.\nModern economics is heavily axiomatic and rigorously mathematical.\nThis, however, does not mean that economics is a purely
